# Commutative algebra
CA: direct sum, quotient ring
CA: GCD domain, Bezout's identity, 
CA: Chapter 10 (completions) of Atiyah & MacDonald (associated graded ring)
CA: Chapter 11 (dimension theory) of Atiyah & MacDonald (Hilbert function)
CA: Hilbert polynomials/series (See Chapter 11 of Commutative Algebra, M. Atiyah)

# Algebraic Geometry
AG: example invertible sheaves: correspondence to divisors
AG: big P-site = { jointly surjective P-morphisms }
AG: small P-site = full subcategory of Sch/X such that U -> X also has P, written X_P (e.g. X_{etale})

AG: examples fppf/fpqc
    Example: sqcup every point ---> affine line (is flat and surjective, but does not satisfy the qcompactness)

# Number theory
NT: quadratic reciprocity
NT: lectures notes of Peter Stevenhagen. Both NT and Topics in Number Theory

GT: parabolic subgroup

# Category theory
CT: pullback, pushout
CT: retract (not a retraction)

CA/NT: Galois correspondence



# Representation theory
RT: Representation Theory!
