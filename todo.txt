Hilbert polynomials/series (See Chapter 11 of Commutative Algebra, M. Atiyah)

CA: direct sum, quotient ring
CA: GCD domain, Bezout's identity, 
    
AG: etale, smooth, unramified, etc.
AG: flat map
    
AG: example invertible sheaves: correspondence to divisors

RT: Representation Theory!

Group theory: parabolic subgroup

AG: faithfully flat = flat and map on '... ? ' is surjective

CA: Ã©tale algebra


# Basically, go through Atiyah & MacDonald

# Category theory

CT: pullback, pushout

AG: big P-site = { jointly surjective P-morphisms }
AG: small P-site = full subcategory of Sch/X such that U -> X also has P, written X_P (e.g. X_{etale})
