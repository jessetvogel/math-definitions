CA: direct sum, quotient ring
CA: GCD domain, Bezout's identity, 
CA: étale algebra
CA: Chapter 10 (completions) of Atiyah & MacDonald (associated graded ring)

# Algebraic Geometry
AG: etale, smooth, unramified, etc.
AG: example invertible sheaves: correspondence to divisors
AG: faithfully flat morphism = flat and map on '... ? ' is surjective
AG: big P-site = { jointly surjective P-morphisms }
AG: small P-site = full subcategory of Sch/X such that U -> X also has P, written X_P (e.g. X_{etale})

AG: examples fppf/fpqc
    Example: sqcup every point ---> affine line (is flat and surjective, but does not satisfy the qcompactness)

# Number theory
NT: quadratic reciprocity
NT: lectures notes of Peter Stevenhagen. Both NT and Topics in Number Theory

# Representation theory

Group theory: parabolic subgroup

# Category theory
CT: pullback, pushout
CT: sheaf on grothendieck topology
CT: retract (not a retraction)
CT: localization 6.1. Definition. Let C be a category, and W ⊆ C a class of morphisms. A functor F : C → D is said to be a localization of C with respect to W if
(i) F(f) is an isomorphism for each f ∈ W, and
(ii) whenever G : C → D′ is a functor carrying elements of W into isomorphisms, there exists a unique functor G′ : D → D′ such that G′F = G.

CA/NT: Galois correspondence

AT: homotopy groups
