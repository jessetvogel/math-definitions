AG: Luna slice theorem (Theorem 14.78 of JS Milne)

HA: Verdier quotient by full triangulated (left/right) admissible subcategory gives orthogonal complement (proof??)
HA: exceptional sequence example: any line bundle in D^b(X) for X connected smooth projective. Hom(L, L) = k, and Ext^(i > 0)(L, L) = 0, since $L$ locally free! ??
HA: (Semiorthogonal decomposition for projective bundles)

AG: Brauer group of field parametrizes CSA's / (Morita) equivalence
    - Brauer group of RR is ZZ/2ZZ = { RR, HH }, Brauer group finite field / algebraically closed field is trivial (https://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/scripties/AbtienJavanpeykarBach.pdf)

CA: Morita equivalence equivalent to M_n(R) = M_m(S) for some n, m ?
