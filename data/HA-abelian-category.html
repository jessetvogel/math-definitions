    An <b>abelian category</b> is a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> such that
    <ul><li> every <span class="math inline">\(\Hom(M, N)\)</span> is an abelian group, and composition is bilinear,
        </li><li> there is an object <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> which is both <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('CT:terminal');">terminal</a> and <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('CT:initial');">initial</a>,
        </li><li> for all <span class="math inline">\(M, N\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>, the direct product <span class="math inline">\(M \times N\)</span> and direct sum <span class="math inline">\(M \oplus N\)</span> exist and are isomorphic,
        </li><li> all kernels and cokernels exist,
        </li><li> every monomoprhism is the kernel of some morphism, and every epimoprhism is the cokernel of some morphism.
    </li></ul>
    
    Examples include
    <ul><li> the category of abelian groups
        </li><li> the category of left modules over a ring <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
        </li><li> the category of sheaves on a topological space
    </li></ul>
