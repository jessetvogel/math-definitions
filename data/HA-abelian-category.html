    An <b>abelian category</b> is a category such that
    <ul><li> every <span class="math inline">\(\Hom(A, B)\)</span> is an abelian group, and composition is bilinear,
        </li><li> it has a zero object,
        </li><li> it has all binary biproducts,
        </li><li> it has all kernels and cokernels,
        </li><li> every monomoprhism is the kernel of some morphism, and every epimoprhism is the cokernel of some morphism.
    </li></ul>
