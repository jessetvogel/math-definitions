A <b>differential graded category</b> is a category whose morphism sets are <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('HA:chain-complex');">cochain complexes</a>, that is
<span class="math display">\[ \Hom(A, B) = \bigoplus_{n \in \ZZ} \Hom_n(A, B) \]</span>
with differential <span class="math inline">\(d : \Hom_n(A, B) \to \Hom_{n + 1}(A, B)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(d^2 = 0\)</span>. Furthermore, composition of morphisms
<span class="math display">\[ \Hom(A, B) \otimes \Hom(B, C) \to \Hom(A, C) \]</span>
must be a chain map and <span class="math inline">\(d(\id_A) = 0\)</span>.
