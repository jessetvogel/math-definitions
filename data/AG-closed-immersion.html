A <b>closed immersion</b> is a morphism <span class="math inline">\(i : Z \to X\)</span> of <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('AG:scheme');">schemes</a> such that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> induces a <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('TO:homeomorphism');">homeomorphism</a> of the underlying space of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> onto a closed subset of that of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and furthermore the induced map <span class="math inline">\(f^\# : \mathcal{O}_X \to f_*\mathcal{O}_Z\)</span> of sheaves on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is surjective.
