An <b>additive category</b> is a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> such that
<ul><li> every <span class="math inline">\(\Hom_\mathcal{A}(A, B)\)</span> is an abelian group, and composition is bilinear,
</li><li> there is a zero object <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> which is both <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('CT:terminal');">terminal</a> and <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('CT:initial');">initial</a>,
</li><li> direct sums and direct products exist, and coincide.
