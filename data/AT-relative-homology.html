    Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a topological space, <span class="math inline">\(X' \subset X\)</span> a subspace, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> an abelian group. The <b>relative chain complex</b> of <span class="math inline">\((X, X')\)</span> is defined as the quotient complex
    <span class="math display">\[ C_n(X, X'; A) = C_n(X; A) / C_n(X'; A) .  \]</span>
    Its <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('AT:homology-group');">homology groups</a>
    <span class="math display">\[ H_n(X, X'; A) = H_n(C_\bullet(X, X; A)) \]</span>
    are called <b>relative homology groups</b> of <span class="math inline">\((X, X')\)</span>.
