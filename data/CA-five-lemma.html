    Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> be an abelian category, and consider the following commutative diagram.

    Suppose that both rows are exact. The <b>five lemma</b> states that
    <ul><li> if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> are injective and <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is surjective, then <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is injective.
        
        </li><li> if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> are surjective and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is injective, then <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is surjective.
        
        </li><li> if <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> are isomorphisms, <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is surjective and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is injective, then <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is an isomorphism.
    </li></ul>
