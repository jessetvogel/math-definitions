A <b>topological space</b> is a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> together with family <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> of subsets of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> satisfying
<ul><li> <span class="math inline">\(X, \varnothing \in \mathcal{T}\)</span>,
</li><li> the intersection of any two sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span>,
</li><li> the union of any collection of sets in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span>.
</li></ul><br/>
The family <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> is called a <b>topology</b> for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and the members of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> are referred to as <b>open sets</b>. A subset <span class="math inline">\(V \subset X\)</span> is called <b>closed</b> if its complement <span class="math inline">\(X \backslash V\)</span> is open.
