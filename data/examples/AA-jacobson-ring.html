<div class="example">A <a href="#CA:local-ring">local ring</a> <span class="math inline">\((R, \mathfrak{m})\)</span> is Jacobson if and only there are no other prime ideals than the maximal ideal, i.e. if the <a href="#CA:krull-dimension">Krull dimension</a> is zero. In particular, a <a href="#CA:discrete-valuation-ring">discrete valuation ring</a> is not Jacobson.<br/>
The intuition is that the closed points (i.e. maximal ideals) of a Jacobson scheme completely characterize the scheme. For local rings this is only the case if the ring is a field.
