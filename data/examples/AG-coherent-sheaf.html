<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a <a href="#AA:discrete-valuation-ring">discrete valuation ring</a> and <span class="math inline">\(X = \Spec(R) = \{ m, \eta \}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> the closed point and <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> the generic point. Then the <a href="#AG:sheaf-of-ideals">sheaf of ideals</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I} \subset \mathcal{O}_X\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}(X) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}(\{ \eta \}) = K\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the <a href="#AA:field-of-fractions">field of fractions</a> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, is not quasi-coherent. Namely, the only open neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> itself, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}|_X = \mathcal{I}\)</span> is not isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{\mathcal{I}(X)} = 0\)</span>.<br/>
In particular, this shows that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}\)</span> does not define a closed subscheme of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Indeed, the support of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\{ \eta \}\)</span>, which is not closed.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(X = \Spec(\ZZ)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y = \bigsqcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} X = \Spec\left(\prod_{i = 1}^\infty \ZZ \right)\)</span>, with the obvious morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : Y \to X\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f_* \mathcal{O}_Y\)</span> is not a quasi-coherent <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span>-module. Namely, if it were quasi-coherent, then in particular every <span class="math inline">\(n \in \ZZ\)</span> should induce a natural isomorphism
<span class="math display">\[ \prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} \ZZ_n \isom \left(\prod_{i = 1}^{\infty} \ZZ \right)_n . \]</span>
However, the element <span class="math inline">\((1, 1/n, 1/n^2, 1/n^3, \ldots)\)</span> does exist on the left-hand side, but not on the right-hand side for <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 2\)</span>.
