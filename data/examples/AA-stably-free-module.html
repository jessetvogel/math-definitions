<div class="example">Clearly any <a href="#AA:free-module">free module</a> is stably free, but the converse is not true. Namely, let <span class="math inline">\(R = \RR[x, y, z] / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1)\)</span> and consider the morphism
<span class="math display">\[ \sigma : R^3 \to R, \quad (a, b, c) \mapsto ax + by + cz . \]</span>
As <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is surjective, we have <span class="math inline">\(R^3 = \ker(\sigma) \oplus R\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(P = \ker(\sigma)\)</span> is stably free. However, note that geometrically any element <span class="math inline">\((a, b, c) \in P\)</span> defines a vector field <span class="math inline">\(X = a \partial_x + b \partial_y + c \partial_z\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-sphere <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>. So if <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> were free, there would exist a basis of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, which would yield two vector fields <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> that are linear independent at every point of <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>. However, this is impossible by the <a href="#DG:hairy-ball-theorem">hairy ball theorem</a>, so <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> cannot be free.
