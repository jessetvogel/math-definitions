<div class="example">The idempotent elements of a commutative ring <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> are in bijection with the decompositions of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> as a product <span class="math inline">\(R = R_1 \times R_2\)</span>. Indeed, every such decomposition yields the idempotent element <span class="math inline">\((1, 0)\)</span>. Conversely, for every idempotent <span class="math inline">\(e \in R\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(Re\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R(1 - e)\)</span> are subrings of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and we have an isomorphism
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned}
        R &\isom Re \times R(1 - e) \\
        r &\mapsto (re, r - re)
    \end{aligned} \]</span>
whose inverse is <span class="math inline">\((a, b) \mapsto a + b\)</span>. Clearly these two constructions are inverse to each other.
