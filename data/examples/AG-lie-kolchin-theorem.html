<div class="example">The conditions in the above theorem are all necessary:
<ul><li> (<i>connected</i>) The algebraic group <span class="math inline">\(G = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \right\} \isom \ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span> is smooth and solvable, but not connected. Also <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is not triangularizable, since for the natural representation of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(k^2\)</span>, the two matrices have no common eigenvector.
</li><li> (<i>smooth</i>) Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be an (algebraically closed) field of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(G \subset \textup{SL}_2\)</span> be the algebraic group given by
<span class="math display">\[ G(R) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in \textup{Mat}_{2 \times 2}(R) : a^2 = d^2 = 1 \textup{ and } b^2 = c^2 = 0 \right\} . \]</span>
Then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected (topologically it is a point) but not smooth, and the exact sequence
<span class="math display">\[ 1 \to \mu_2 \xrightarrow{a \mapsto \left(\begin{smallmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & a \end{smallmatrix}\right)} G \xrightarrow{\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix}\right) \mapsto (ab, cd)} \alpha_2 \times \alpha_2 \to 1 \]</span>
shows that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is solvable. However, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is not triangularizable since the natural action of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(k^2\)</span> does not fix any line.
</li><li> (<i>solvable</i>) Any triangularizable group is solvable.
</li><li> (<i>algebraically closed</i>) Let <span class="math inline">\(k = \RR\)</span> and consider the algebraic group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> given by
<span class="math display">\[ G(R) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{pmatrix} \in \textup{Mat}_{2 \times 2}(R) : a^2 + b^2 = 1 \right\} . \]</span>
Then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is solvable (since it is abelian), connected and smooth. However it is not triangularizable since it does not have eigenvectors when acting naturally on <span class="math inline">\(\RR^2\)</span>.
</li></ul>
