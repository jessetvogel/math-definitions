<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(G = \textup{GL}_n(\RR)\)</span> be the the <a href="#LA:general-linear-group">general linear group</a>. The <a href="#LA:determinant">determinant</a> <span class="math inline">\(\det : G \to \RR^*\)</span> has constant value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\([G, G]\)</span>, since the determinant of products of commutators is always <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Conversely, after showing that any matrix of determinant <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> can be written as a product of commutators, it follows that
<span class="math display">\[ \det : G / [G, G] \xrightarrow{\sim} \RR^* \]</span>
is an isomorphism.
