<div class="example">Any strict epimorphism <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> is an <a href="#CT:epimorphism">epimorphism</a>. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta : Y \to Z\)</span> are morphisms with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha f = \beta f\)</span>. Then pick <span class="math inline">\(g = \alpha f = \beta f\)</span> and note that <span class="math inline">\(fx = fy\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(gx = gy\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x, y : W \to X\)</span>. Hence there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(h : Y \to Z\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(g = hf\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> both satisfy this property, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \beta\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">In <b>Set</b>, any epimorphism (surjective map) is a strict epimorphism, this is easy to check. However, in the category <b>Top</b> of <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological spaces</a> this is not the case. Consider <span class="math inline">\(X = [0, 1) \sqcup [1, 2]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y = [0, 2]\)</span> and the epimorphism (continuous surjective map) <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y, x \mapsto x\)</span>. Whenever two maps <span class="math inline">\(k, \ell : W \to X\)</span> satisfy <span class="math inline">\(fk = f\ell\)</span>, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(k = \ell\)</span> as this can be checked on the level of sets. However, there does not exist a continuous map <span class="math inline">\(h : Y \to X\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\id_X = hf\)</span>.
