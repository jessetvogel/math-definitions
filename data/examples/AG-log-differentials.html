<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a field with characteristic <span class="math inline">\(\ne 2\)</span>. Consider the map <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1_k \to \AA^1_k\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(t = s^2\)</span>. The usual sheaf of differentials <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^1_{\AA^1_k}\)</span> is given by the free <span class="math inline">\(k[x]\)</span>-module with generator <span class="math inline">\(\dif x\)</span>, and the above map induces
<span class="math display">\[ \Omega^1_{\AA^1_k} \to \Omega^1_{\AA^1_k}, \qquad \dif t \mapsto 2 s \dif s \]</span>
The idea is that this map is not very nice in the sense that the cokernel has support at <span class="math inline">\(s = 0\)</span>, and that we &lsquo;fix&rsquo; this using log differentials.<br/>
Take the divisor <span class="math inline">\(D = \{ 0 \}\)</span>, and consider the log structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1_k\)</span> given by
<span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{M} = \{ f \in \mathcal{O}_X : f \text{ is invertible outside } D \} . \]</span>
Note that <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathcal{M}\)</span>, so we obtain <span class="math inline">\(\dif \log(x) = \frac{\dif x}{x} \in \omega^1_{\AA^1_k}\)</span>. In fact, one can show that <span class="math inline">\(\omega^1_{\AA^1_k}\)</span> is given by the free <span class="math inline">\(k[x]\)</span>-module generated by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\dif x}{x}\)</span>. Now the map from before is given by
<span class="math display">\[ \omega^1_{\AA^1_k} \to \omega^1_{\AA^1_k} \qquad  \qquad \frac{\dif t}{t} \mapsto 2 \frac{\dif s} s , \]</span>
which is now an isomorphism.
