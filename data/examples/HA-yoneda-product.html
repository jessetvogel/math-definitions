<div class="example">For <span class="math inline">\(n = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m = 1\)</span> we have that the product of <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span> (in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^0(A, B) = \Hom(A, B)\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(\eta : 0 \to C \to F_0 \to B \to 0\)</span> (in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^1(A, B)\)</span>) is
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to C \to F_0 \oplus_B A \to A \to 0 . \]</span>
It is not hard to verify this sequence is indeed exact.
