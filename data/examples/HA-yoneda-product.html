<div class="example">For <span class="math inline">\(n = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m = 1\)</span>, we have that the product of <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^0(A, B) = \Hom(A, B)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eta : 0 \to C \to F_0 \to B \to 0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^1(B, C)\)</span> is the <i>pullback</i>
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to C \to F_0 \oplus_B A \to A \to 0 . \]</span>
Similarly, for <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m = 0\)</span>, the product of <span class="math inline">\(0 \to B \to E_0 \to A \to 0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^1(A, B)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g : B \to C\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ext}^0(B, C) = \Hom(B, C)\)</span> is the <i>pushout</i>
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to C \to C \oplus_B E_0 \to A \to 0 . \]</span>
It is not hard to verify these sequences are indeed exact.
