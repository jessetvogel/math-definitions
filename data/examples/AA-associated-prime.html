<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(R = k[x, y]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M = k[x, y] / (x^2, xy)\)</span>. The prime ideals associated to <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are
<span class="math display">\[ \mathfrak{p}_1 = (x) \quad \textup{ and } \quad \mathfrak{p}_2 = (x, y) , \]</span>
annihilating <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, respectively. Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}_1 \subset \mathfrak{p}_2\)</span>, the prime ideal <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}_1\)</span> is isolated, while <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}_2\)</span> is embedded.<br/>
Geometrically, this corresponds to the closed subscheme defined by <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}_2\)</span> being embedded in the closed subscheme defined by <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}_1\)</span>.
