<div class="example">The extension <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}) / \QQ\)</span> is not normal. Indeed the minimal polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f = x^3 - 2\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[3]{2}\)</span> is irreducible over <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>, but it does not split completely in <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2})\)</span>. Namely, consider <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2})\)</span> as a subfield of <span class="math inline">\(\RR\)</span>. Then the other two roots of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> are complex: <span class="math inline">\(\pm \sqrt[3]{2} e^{2 \pi i / 3}\)</span>. Since they do not lie in <span class="math inline">\(\RR\)</span>, they do not lie in <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2})\)</span>.
