<div class="example">The Jacobi identity for a Lie algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> is equivalent to saying <span class="math inline">\(\textup{ad}_X\)</span> is a derivation for all <span class="math inline">\(X \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>, that is,
<span class="math display">\[ \textup{ad}_X([Y, Z]) = [\textup{ad}_X(Y), Z] + [Y, \textup{ad}_X(Z)] . \]</span>
Moreover, from the Jacobi identity follows that
<span class="math display">\[ \textup{ad}_{[X, Y]}(Z) = [[X, Y], Z] = [X, [Y, Z]] - [Y, [X, Z]] = [\textup{ad}_X, \textup{ad}_Y](Z) , \]</span>
which shows that the map <span class="math inline">\(\textup{ad} : \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g})\)</span> is a Lie algebra homomorphism.
