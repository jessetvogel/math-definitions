</div><div class="example">Given bordisms <span class="math inline">\(W : M \to M'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W' : M' \to M''\)</span>, it can be shown that <span class="math inline">\(W \sqcup_{M'} W'\)</span> admits a smooth structure such that the inclusions <span class="math inline">\(W \to W \sqcup_{M'} W'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W' \to W \sqcup_{M'} W'\)</span> are diffeomorphisms onto their images, which is unique up to (non-unique) diffeomorphism. Hence <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W'\)</span> can be ‘composed’ to produce a bordism <span class="math inline">\(W' \circ W : M \to M''\)</span>, which is well-defined up to isomorphism.<br/>
Using this composition rule, one can define the <i>category of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-bordisms</i> <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Bord}_n\)</span>, where the objects are <span class="math inline">\((n - 1)\)</span>-dimensional closed manifolds and where the morphisms are bordsims are taken up to isomorphism. In particular, the identity morphism of an object <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the cylinder <span class="math inline">\(\id_M = M \times [0, 1]\)</span>.
