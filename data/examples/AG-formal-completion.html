<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a field and consider <span class="math inline">\(X = \Spec k[x]\)</span> with closed subscheme <span class="math inline">\(Y \subset X\)</span> given by the ideal <span class="math inline">\((x)\)</span>. Then the formal completion of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has a topological space consisting of one point, with sheaf of rings given by <span class="math inline">\(k \llbracket x \rrbracket\)</span>.<br/>
Note that this locally ringed space is not the same as <span class="math inline">\(\Spec k \llbracket x \rrbracket\)</span>, whose topological space has two points, given by the prime ideals <span class="math inline">\((0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((x)\)</span>.
