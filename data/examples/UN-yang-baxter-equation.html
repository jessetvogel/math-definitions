<div class="example">Consider a physical system consisting of three identical particles, each modeled by a vector space <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. The interaction of two colliding particles can be represented by an endomorphism <span class="math inline">\(R : V \otimes V \to V \otimes V\)</span>. From relativistic principles, the order of interactions should not matter, so the following diagrams should correspond to the same interaction.

This relation precisely corresponds to the Yangâ€“Baxter equation.
