<div class="example">The tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_\phi X\)</span> can be identified with <span class="math inline">\(H^1(\pi_1(\Sigma), \mathfrak{g}_{\textup{Ad}(\phi)})\)</span> as follows. Consider a path <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> given by
<span class="math display">\[ \phi_t(\alpha) = \exp(t u(\alpha) + \mathcal{O}(t^2)) \phi(\alpha) , \]</span>
for some <span class="math inline">\(u : \pi_1(\Sigma) \to \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. The condition <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t(\alpha \beta) = \phi_t(\alpha) \phi_t(\beta)\)</span> translates to
<span class="math display">\[ u(\alpha \beta) = u(\alpha) + \textup{Ad}(\phi(\alpha))(u(\beta)) , \]</span>
which is the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-cocycle condition for <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(\Sigma)\)</span> acts on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> composed with the adjoint representation. The action of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is given by conjugation, so a path <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t\)</span> is trivial if <span class="math inline">\(\phi_t(\alpha) = g_t^{-1} \phi(\alpha) g_t\)</span> for some path
<span class="math display">\[ g_t = \exp(t v + \mathcal{O}(t^2)) \]</span>
on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(v \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. This is the case when <span class="math inline">\(u(\alpha) = \textup{Ad}(\phi(\alpha))(v) - v\)</span>, that is, when <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a principal homomorphism. Therefore, the tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_\phi X\)</span> is precisely the first cohomology group <span class="math inline">\(H^1(\pi_1(\Sigma), \mathfrak{g}_{\textup{Ad}(\phi)})\)</span>.
