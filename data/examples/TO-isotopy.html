<div class="example">Every isotopy is a homotopy, but not conversely. Namely, let <span class="math inline">\(X = Y = [0, 1]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f, g : X \to Y\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = 1 - x\)</span>. Then there is a homotopy from <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> given by
<span class="math display">\[ H(x, t) = (1 - t) x - t (1 - x) . \]</span>
However, no isotopy from <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> can exist, since for any homotopy from <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the endpoints must cross for some <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.
