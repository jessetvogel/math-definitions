<div class="example">Note that the usual (co)limits in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> may not behave well with respect to the model structure. For example, take <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C} = \textbf{Top}\)</span> with the usual model structure, and consider the diagram

with <span class="math inline">\(i : S^{n - 1} \to D^n\)</span> the inclusion of the boundary, and where all vertical maps are homotopy equivalences. The usual pushout of the top row is homeomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(S^n\)</span>, while the usual pushout of the bottom row is a point, and the induced map <span class="math inline">\(S^n \to *\)</span> is not a homotopy equivalence. The ‘correct’ pushout (the homotopy pushout) is given by the top row, since <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is a cofibration while <span class="math inline">\(S^{n - 1} \to *\)</span> is not.
</div><div class="example">The <a href="#AT:loop-space">loop space</a> <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_x X\)</span> of a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with basepoint <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> can be seen as a homotopy pullback:

Namely, a fibrant replacement for <span class="math inline">\(* \xrightarrow{x} X \xleftarrow{x} *\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(P_x X \rightarrow X \leftarrow P_x X\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P_x X\)</span> denotes the <a href="#AT:path-space">path space</a> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. These diagrams are homotopy equivalent since <span class="math inline">\(x \to P_x X\)</span>, the map to the constant path, is a homotopy equivalence.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a field, let <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ch}(k)\)</span> the category of chain complexes over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and suppose we want to compute the homotopy fiber product <span class="math inline">\(k \times_{k \oplus k[n]} k\)</span>. First note that <span class="math inline">\(k \to k \oplus k[n]\)</span> factors as <span class="math inline">\(k \xrightarrow{i} k \oplus C(\id_{k[n]}) \xrightarrow{p} k \oplus k[n]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(C(\id_{k[n]}) = k[n] \oplus k[n - 1]\)</span> is the <a href="#HA:mapping-cone">mapping cone</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\id_{k[n]}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is an acyclic cofibration, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> a fibration. Hence, after a fibrant replacement, we can compute the fiber product as usual:

Finally, since <span class="math inline">\([ \cdots \to k \xrightarrow{\Delta} k^2 \to \cdots ]\)</span> is quasi-isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\([ \cdots \to 0 \to k \to \cdots ]\)</span>, we can also write the homotopy fiber product as <span class="math inline">\(k \oplus k[n - 1]\)</span>.
