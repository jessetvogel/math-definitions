<div class="example">Consider the matrix
<span class="math display">\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix} . \]</span>
Its characteristic polynomial is <span class="math inline">\(p_A(\lambda) = (2 - \lambda)^2 (3 - \lambda)\)</span>. Hence the eigenvalues are <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\)</span> (with alg. multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 3\)</span> (with alg. multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>). However, both have a geometric multiplicity of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> as
<span class="math display">\[ E_2 = \ker(A - 2I) = \text{span}(1, 0, 0) \quad \text{ and } \quad E_3 = \ker(A - 3I) = \text{span}(0, 0, 1) . \]</span>
