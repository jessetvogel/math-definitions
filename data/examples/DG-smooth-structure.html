<div class="example">A topological manifold can have multiple different smooth structures. Namely, consider the (open) disk <span class="math inline">\(M = \{ x \in \RR^n : |x| < 1 \}\)</span> as a topological manifold, and define a family of homeomorphisms
<span class="math display">\[ \varphi_k : M \to M, \quad \varphi_k(x) = |x|^{k - 1} x . \]</span>
Then for every <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 1\)</span>, the chart <span class="math inline">\((M, \varphi_k)\)</span> defines a smooth structure on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. However, these charts are not smoothly compatible since
<span class="math display">\[ \varphi_\ell \circ \varphi_k^{-1} (x) = |x|^{\ell/k - 1} x \]</span>
is not smooth at the origin for <span class="math inline">\(\ell < k\)</span>.
