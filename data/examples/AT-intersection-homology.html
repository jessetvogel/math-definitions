<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the <a href="#TO:suspension">suspension</a> of two disjoint circles (think of two bananas whose ends are connected). The singular homology of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[ H_0(X; \QQ) = \QQ, \quad H_1(X; \QQ) = \QQ, \quad H_2(X; \QQ) = \QQ \oplus \QQ . \]</span>
Indeed, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has one connected component, <span class="math inline">\(H_1(X; \QQ)\)</span> is generated by the loop along both bananas, and <span class="math inline">\(H_2(X; \QQ)\)</span> is generated by the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-chains given by the bananas.<br/>
In contrast, let us consider the intersection homology of <span class="math inline">\(X = X_2 \supset X_1 = X_0 = \{ a, b \}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are the points connecting the two bananas. Since we only need <span class="math inline">\(p(2) = 0\)</span>, the choice of perversity does not matter. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-allowable singular <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-simplices are those points that are not <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-allowable singular <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-simplices are those that do not hit <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-allowable singular <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-simplices are those <span class="math inline">\(\sigma : \Delta^2 \to X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{-1}(\{ a, b \})\)</span> only contains the vertices of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^2\)</span>. Therefore, one finds
<span class="math display">\[ I^p H_0(X; \QQ) = \QQ \oplus \QQ, \quad I^p H_1(X; \QQ) = 0, \quad I^p H_2(X; \QQ) = \QQ \oplus \QQ \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(I^p H_0(X; \QQ)\)</span> is generated by a point on each banana, and <span class="math inline">\(I^p H_2(X; \QQ)\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(H_2(X; \QQ)\)</span>. Note that the singular <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-chain which goes along both bananas is no longer allowed. Also, two points on different bananas cannot be connected by an (allowable) <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-chain anymore.
