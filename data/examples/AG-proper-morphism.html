<div class="example">The morphism <span class="math inline">\(\AA_k^1 \to \Spec k\)</span> is not proper as it is not universally closed. Namely, the projection <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1_k \times \AA^1_k \to \AA^1_k\)</span> sends the closed set <span class="math inline">\(\{ xy - 1 \}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1_k - \{ 0 \}\)</span> and thus cannot be a closed mapping. However, the morphism is clearly of finite type, and also separated as the diagonal <span class="math inline">\(\Delta : \AA^1_k \to \AA^1_k \times \AA^1_k\)</span> is closed, it is given by <span class="math inline">\(\{ x - y = 0 \}\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the affine line with double origin, i.e. two copies of <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1\)</span> glued along <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1 \backslash \{ 0 \}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(X \to \AA^1\)</span> is of finite type and universally closed (the latter as <span class="math inline">\(X_R \to \AA^1_R\)</span> is closed for all rings <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>). However, <span class="math inline">\(X \to \AA^1\)</span> is not separated and hence not proper. For this we need to show <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{X / \AA^1} : X \to X \times_{\AA^1} X\)</span> is not a closed immersion. Consider <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1 \to X \times_{\AA^1} X\)</span> induced from the two maps different maps <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1 \to X\)</span>, and note that the inverse image of the diagonal is <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1 \backslash \{ 0 \}\)</span> which is not closed. Hence the diagonal is not closed.
