<div class="example">The groups <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_m, \text{GL}_n(\CC), \text{SL}_n(\CC)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{PGL}_n(\CC)\)</span> are all reductive. Also any finite group is reductive.<br/>
A group which is not reductive is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_a\)</span>. Namely, since it is solvable (it is abelian) its radical is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_a\)</span>, which is not a torus. Also, we see that it is not linearly reductive: take <span class="math inline">\(V = k^2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_a\)</span> acting via <span class="math inline">\(t \cdot (x, y) = (x + ty, y)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(U := k \cdot (1, 0) \subset V\)</span> is a sub-<span class="math inline">\(k[\mathbb{G}_a]\)</span>-module, but <span class="math inline">\(V \not\simeq U \oplus (V / U)\)</span>.
