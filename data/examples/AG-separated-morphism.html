<div class="example">Any morphism of affine schemes is separated. Namely, for any <span class="math inline">\(f : \Spec A \to \Spec B\)</span>, the diagonal <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> corresponds to the ring map <span class="math inline">\(A \otimes_B A \to A : a \otimes a' \mapsto aa'\)</span>, which is clearly surjective. In this way <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is seen as a quotient of <span class="math inline">\(A \otimes_B A\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is a closed immersion.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the affine line with two origins, that is, glue two copies of <span class="math inline">\(\AA_k^1\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(\AA_k^1 - \{ 0 \}\)</span>. We claim that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not separated over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Namely, consider the map <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1_k \to X \times_k X\)</span> obtained from the two different maps <span class="math inline">\(\AA_k^1 \to X\)</span>. Then the inverse image of the diagonal is <span class="math inline">\(\AA_k^1 - \{ 0 \}\)</span>, which is not closed. Hence, the diagonal is not closed and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is not a closed immersion.
