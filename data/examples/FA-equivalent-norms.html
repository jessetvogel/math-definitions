<div class="example">On a finite-dimensional vector space <span class="math inline">\(V = \RR^n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\CC^n\)</span>, all norms are equivalent. Namely, since the unit sphere is compact, both norms <span class="math inline">\(\norm{\cdot}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\norm{\cdot}_2\)</span> attain minima <span class="math inline">\(m_1, m_2\)</span> and maxima <span class="math inline">\(M_1, M_2\)</span> on the sphere. Now it follows that
<span class="math display">\[ \frac{m_2}{M_1} \norm{x}_1 \le \norm{x}_2 \le \frac{M_2}{m_1} \norm{x}_1 \]</span>
for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in V\)</span> by linearity.
