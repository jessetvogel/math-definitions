<div class="example">Every <a href="#AG:finite-morphism">finite morphism</a> is quasi-finite, but the converse is not true. Namely, consider the immersion
<span class="math display">\[ i : \Spec \ZZ[\tfrac{1}{2}] \to \Spec \ZZ . \]</span>
Since <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is an open immersion, all fibers either consist of a single point or are empty. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is of finite type as <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ[\tfrac{1}{2}]\)</span> is a finitely generated <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-algebra, and <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is quasi-compact since the source and target are affine, hence <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is quasi-finite. However, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is not finite since <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ[\tfrac{1}{2}]\)</span> is not finitely generated as a <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-module.
