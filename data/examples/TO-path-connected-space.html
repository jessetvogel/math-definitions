<div class="example">Every path-connected space is <a href="#TO:connected-space">connected</a>, but not conversely. Namely, consider
<span class="math display">\[ X = \{ (x, \sin \tfrac{1}{x}) : x \in (0, 1] \} \cup \{ (0, 0) \} \subset \RR^2 , \]</span>
with the topology induced from the Euclidean plane. Then <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is connected, since it is the closure of the image of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (0, 1] \to X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto (x, \sin \tfrac{1}{x})\)</span>. However, there is no way to connect <span class="math inline">\((0, 0)\)</span> with any other point via a path.
