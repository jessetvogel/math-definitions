<div class="example">Consider <span class="math inline">\(G = \GG_m^2\)</span> acting naturally on <span class="math inline">\(X = \AA^2_k\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(\lambda : \GG_m \to G\)</span> be the one-parameter subgroup given by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(t) = (t, t^{-1})\)</span>. One can only choose <span class="math inline">\(Z_\lambda^0\)</span> to be equal to the fixed-point locus <span class="math inline">\(X^\lambda = \{ (0, 0) \}\)</span>, which yields <span class="math inline">\(Z_\lambda = S_\lambda = \{ (x, 0) \in \AA^2_k \}\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(P_\lambda = G\)</span> and indeed the morphism <span class="math inline">\(G \times_{P_\lambda} Z_\lambda \to S_\lambda\)</span> is an isomorphism.
Therefore, we have constructed an HKKN stratification with <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_0 = X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X_1 = X \setminus S_\lambda\)</span>.
