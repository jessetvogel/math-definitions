<div class="example">Every arc-connected space is path-connected, but not conversely. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the line with two origins, that is, <span class="math inline">\(X = (\RR \times \{ 0 \}) \sqcup (\RR \times \{ 1 \}) / \sim{}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\((x, 0) \sim{} (x, 1)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \ne 0\)</span>. Then the two origins <span class="math inline">\((0, 0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((0, 1)\)</span> are topologically distinguishable, and even though there exist paths <span class="math inline">\(f : [0, 1] \to X\)</span> connecting them, such an <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is never an embedding as there are points which it hits at least twice.
