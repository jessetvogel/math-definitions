<div class="example">Any <a href="#AG:flasque-sheaf">flasque sheaf</a> is soft, but not conversely. Namely, consider <span class="math inline">\(X = \{ a, b \}\)</span> with topology <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T} = \{ \varnothing, \{ a \}, X \}\)</span> and sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> given by
<span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{F}(\{ a \}) = \ZZ \quad \textup{ and } \quad \mathcal{F}(X) = 0 . \]</span>
Then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is not flasque as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}(X) \to \mathcal{F}(\{ a \})\)</span> is not surjective, but <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is soft as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{F}(\{ b \}) = \colim_{U \supset \{ b \}} \mathcal{F}(U) = \mathcal{F}(X) = 0\)</span> is surjective.
