<div class="example">For any integer <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 1\)</span>, consider the covering space <span class="math inline">\(p_n : \CC^\times \to \CC^\times\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(p(z) = z^n\)</span>. The fiber of the basepoint <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> is the set <span class="math inline">\(F = \{ 1, \zeta_n, \ldots, \zeta_n^{n - 1} \}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th roots of unity. The fundamental group <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(\CC^\times, x) = \ZZ\)</span> is freely generated by a loop <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> around the origin, suppose counterclockwise. One can show that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \cdot z = \zeta_n z\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(z \in F\)</span>, which shows that the monodromy group of <span class="math inline">\(p_n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ/n\ZZ\)</span>.
