<div class="example"><ul><li> The field extension <span class="math inline">\(\FF_2[\sqrt{t}] \supset \FF_2[t]\)</span> is normal, since any field extension of degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is normal, but not separable. Namely, the minimal polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{t}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(x^2 - t = (x - \sqrt{t})^2\)</span>, which is not separable.
</li><li> The field extension <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}) \supset \QQ\)</span> is separable, since any field extension over characteristic zero is separable, but not normal. Namely, the conjugates of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[3]{2}\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_3 \sqrt[3]{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_3^2 \sqrt[3]{2}\)</span>, which do not lie in <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2})\)</span>.
</li><li> Its normal closure, <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt[3]{2}, \zeta_3)\)</span>, is normal, and hence a Galois extension of <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>.
</li></ul>
