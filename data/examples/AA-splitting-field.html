<div class="example">Consider <span class="math inline">\(f = x^2 - 101 \in \QQ[x]\)</span>, which is irreducible as <span class="math inline">\(101\)</span> is not a square in <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> splits as <span class="math inline">\((x - \sqrt{101})(x + \sqrt{101})\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt{101})\)</span>, which shows that <span class="math inline">\(\QQ(\sqrt{101})\)</span> is the splitting field of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>.
