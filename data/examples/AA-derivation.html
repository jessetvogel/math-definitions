<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu : B \otimes_A B \to B\)</span> be the multiplication map <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \otimes b_2 \mapsto b_1 b_2\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(I = \ker \mu\)</span>. Consider <span class="math inline">\(B \otimes_A B\)</span> as a <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>-module by multiplication on the left, that is <span class="math inline">\(b \cdot (b_1 \otimes b_2) = (bb_1 \otimes b_2)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(I/I^2\)</span> inherits the structure of a <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>-module, and the map
<span class="math display">\[ d : B \to I/I^2, \quad b \mapsto 1 \otimes b - b \otimes 1 (\text{mod } I^2) \]</span>
is a universal <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>-derivation. This can be seen as follows.<br/>
First note that <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is generated as an <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>-module by elements of the form <span class="math inline">\(1 \otimes b - b \otimes 1\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span>. Namely, for any <span class="math inline">\(x \in I\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\mu(x) = 0\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(x \equiv \mu(x) \otimes 1 \text{ mod } (1 \otimes b - b \otimes 1 : b \in B) = 0\)</span>, and the other inclusion is obvious. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is surjective.<br/>
Now for any other <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>-derivation <span class="math inline">\(d' : B \to M\)</span> we can (and must) define <span class="math inline">\(\phi : I/I^2 \to M\)</span> by putting <span class="math inline">\(\phi(d(b)) = d' b\)</span> and extending <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>-linearly. Indeed this is well-defined as any element of <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> is a sum of elements of the form <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in I\)</span>, and writing <span class="math inline">\(x = \sum_i (1 \otimes b_i - b_i \otimes 1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = \sum_j (1 \otimes b'_j - b'_j \otimes 1)\)</span> we find that
<span class="math display">\[ xy = \sum_{i,j} (1 \otimes b_i b'_j - b_i b'_j \otimes 1) - b_i (1 \otimes b'_j - b'_j \otimes 1) - b'_j (1 \otimes b_i - b_i \otimes 1) , \]</span>
so <span class="math inline">\(\phi(xy) = \sum_{i, j} d'(b_i b'_j) - b_i d' b'_j - b'_j d' b_i = 0\)</span>.

<span class="math display">\[ \Omega_{B/A} = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^{n} B \cdot dx_i . \]</span>
