<div class="example">Any complex manifold is an almost complex manifold, but the converse does not hold. Consider the <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>-sphere inside the (imaginary) octonions
<span class="math display">\[ S^6 = \left\{ \sum_{i = 1}^{7} x_i e_i \in \mathbb{O} : |x| = 1 \right\} , \]</span>
and let <span class="math inline">\(J : TS^6 \to TS^6\)</span> be given at a point <span class="math inline">\(p \in S^6\)</span> by multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(T_p S^6 = p^\perp\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is defines an almost complex structure, but it is not integrable.
