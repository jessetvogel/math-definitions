<div class="example">The map <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> can be factorized as
<span class="math display">\[ X \xrightarrow{i} P_f \xrightarrow{p} Y , \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(i(x) = (x, \text{const}_y)\)</span> is a <a href="#AT:homotopy-equivalence">homotopy equivalence</a>, and <span class="math inline">\(p(x, \gamma) = \gamma(0)\)</span> a <a href="#AT:hurewicz-fibration">Hurewicz fibration</a>. Note that the fiber of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is precisely the homotopy fiber <span class="math inline">\(\text{hofib}(f)\)</span>. Hence, we obtain a long exact sequence
<span class="math display">\[ \cdots \to \pi_n(\text{hofib}(f)) \to \pi_n P_f \to \pi_n Y \to \pi_{n - 1}(\text{hofib}(f)) \to \cdots \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\pi_n P_f \simeq \pi_n X\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is a homotopy equivalence.<br/>
Now the point is that the homotopy fibers of two maps that are (weakly) homotopy equivalent, are (weakly) homotopy equivalent as well. That is, given a commutative square
<img class="display-math-svg" src="data/svg/d0f292812ffc5672f4996dd8a0cb5f0e4fa05005.svg" alt />
where the horizontal arrows are <a href="#AT:weak-homotopy-equivalence">weak homotopy equivalences</a>, the induced map
<span class="math display">\[ \text{hofib}(f) \to \text{hofib}(f'), \quad (x, \gamma) \mapsto (g(x), h \circ \gamma) \]</span>
is a weak homotopy equivalence as well. This follows directly from the two long exact sequences corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> as above, and the <a href="#HA:five-lemma">five lemma</a>.
