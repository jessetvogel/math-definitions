<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(M = \CC^n\)</span> with the standard Hermitian metric <span class="math inline">\(h(-, -)\)</span>. Decomposing in real and imaginary parts, we have
<span class="math display">\[ h(u, v) = g(u, v) + i \omega(u, v) \]</span>
for some bilinear forms <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(h(v, u) = \overline{h(u, v)}\)</span>, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is symmetric and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is skew-symmetric. Moreover, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> are non-degenerate since <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is. In particular, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a Riemannian metric, and <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> a symplectic form. Furthermore, multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> defines an almost complex structure <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. Note that
<span class="math display">\[ g(u, Jv) + i \omega(u, Jv) = h(u, iv) = i h(u, v) = i g(u, v) - \omega(u, v) , \]</span>
from which follows that
<span class="math display">\[ g(u, v) = \omega(u, Jv) , \]</span>
that is, <span class="math inline">\((\omega, J, g)\)</span> is a compatible triple.
