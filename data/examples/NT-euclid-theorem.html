<div class="example"><div class="proof">If there were finitely many prime numbers <span class="math inline">\(p_1, \ldots, p_n\)</span>, then the number <span class="math inline">\(1 + \prod_{i = 1}^{n} p_i\)</span> is coprime to all <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>, so it must have a prime factor different from all <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span>.
