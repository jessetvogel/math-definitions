<div class="example">Every finite <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-set is a disjoint union of its orbits, and any orbit is isomorphic to a <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-set of cosets <span class="math inline">\(G/H\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is the stabilizer of an element in the orbit. Since <span class="math inline">\(G/H \simeq G/H'\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-sets if and only if <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H'\)</span> are conjugate in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(A(G) \simeq \ZZ^c\)</span> as abelian groups, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the number of conjugacy classes of subgroups of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.<br/>
Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a <a href="#GT:simple-group">simple group</a>, so that the only subgroups of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\{ 1 \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> itself. Since <span class="math inline">\([G/G] = 1 \in A(G)\)</span>, we find that <span class="math inline">\(A(G)\)</span> is generated by <span class="math inline">\([G / \{ 1 \}] = [G]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> acts on itself by left multiplication. The isomorphism
<span class="math display">\[ G \times G \to G \times G, \quad (g, h) \mapsto (g, g^{-1} h) \]</span>
shows that <span class="math inline">\([G \times G] = |G| \cdot [G]\)</span>, and hence <span class="math inline">\(A(G) = \ZZ[x] / (x^2 - |G| x)\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a field. Any finite <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> induces a <a href="#RT:permutation-representation">permutation representation</a> <span class="math inline">\(\rho : G \to \textup{GL}\left(k^X\right)\)</span> by permuting the basis vectors indexed by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This induces a ring morphism
<span class="math display">\[ \varphi : A(G) \to R_k(G) \]</span>
to the <a href="#RT:representation-ring">representation ring</a> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.<br/>
This map need not be injective nor surjective. Namely, for <span class="math inline">\(G = S_3\)</span>, we have that
<span class="math display">\[ \varphi(2 [S_3 / \langle (1, 2) \rangle] + [S_3 / \langle (1, 2, 3) \rangle]) = \varphi([S_3] + 2 [S_3 / S_3]) , \]</span>
and for general <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the image of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> only contains rational representations.
