<div class="example">Any <a href="#AG:fppf-covering">fppf covering</a> <span class="math inline">\(\{ f_i : X_i \to X \}_{i \in I}\)</span> is an fpqc covering. By assumption the <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> are flat. Let <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span> be an affine open. Write <span class="math inline">\(f_i^{-1}(U) = \cup_{j \in J_i} U_{ij}\)</span> for some affine opens <span class="math inline">\(U_{ij} \subset X_i\)</span>. Each <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> flat and locally of finite presentation, hence open. So, <span class="math inline">\(U = \cup_{i \in I} \cup_{j \in J_i} f_i(U_{ij})\)</span> is an open cover for <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. Now, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is affine and thus quasi-compact, so there is a finite subcover.
</div><div class="example">A morphism <span class="math inline">\(\Spec A \to \Spec B\)</span> is an fpqc covering if and only if <span class="math inline">\(A \to B\)</span> is faithfully flat.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(X = \AA^1_k\)</span> be the affine line over an infinite field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and consider the natural morphism
<span class="math display">\[ f : \bigsqcup_{x \in X} \Spec(\mathcal{O}_{X, x}) \to X . \]</span>
Altough it is flat and surjective, it does not define an fpqc covering of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, since any affine open of <span class="math inline">\(\bigsqcup_{x \in X} \Spec(\mathcal{O}_{X, x})\)</span> can only consist of finitely many points (because affines are quasi-compact).
