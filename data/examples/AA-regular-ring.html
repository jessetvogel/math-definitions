<div class="example">Every field is a regular local ring: their Krull dimension is zero, and their maximal ideal is <span class="math inline">\((0)\)</span>.
</div><div class="example"><ul><li> The local ring <span class="math inline">\(R = k[x]/(x^2)\)</span> is not a regular local ring. Its only prime ideal is its maximal ideal <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m} = (x)/(x^2)\)</span>, so the Krull dimension is zero, but the minimal number of generators of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> is one.
</li><li> The ring <span class="math inline">\(R = k[x, y]/(y^2 - x^3)\)</span> is not regular. Namely, at the maximal ideal <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m} = (x, y)\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\dim R_\mathfrak{m} = 1\)</span> since the only non-zero prime ideal in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(\dim_k(\mathfrak{m} / \mathfrak{m}^2) = \dim_k(k \cdot x \oplus k \cdot y) = 2\)</span>.
