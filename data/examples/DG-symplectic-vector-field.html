<div class="example">Every <a href="#DG:hamiltonian-vector-field">Hamiltonian vector field</a> is symplectic, since every exact form is closed. The converse is however not true. Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be the <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span>-torus <span class="math inline">\(\RR^{2n}/\ZZ^{2n}\)</span> with the standard symplectic form
<span class="math display">\[ \omega = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} dp_i \wedge dq^i . \]</span>
Then the vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(X(x) = v\)</span> for some constant non-zero <span class="math inline">\(v \in \RR^{2n}\)</span> (identifying <span class="math inline">\(T_x M\)</span> canonically with <span class="math inline">\(\RR^{2n}\)</span>) is symplectic, but not Hamiltonian.
