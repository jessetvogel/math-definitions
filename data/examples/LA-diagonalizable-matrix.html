<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be a diagonalizable matrix, that is, we can write
<span class="math display">\[ A P = P D , \]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> invertible and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> diagonal. From this expression it is clear that the columns of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> must be <a href="#LA:eigenvalue">eigenvectors</a> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and that <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> contains the corresponding eigenvalues. The matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> being invertible means that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> linearly independent eigenvectors.
