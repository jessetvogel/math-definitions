<div class="example"><ul><li> The groups <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_m, \mathbb{G}_a, \textup{GL}_n, \textup{SL}_n, \textup{Sp}_{2n}\)</span> are special algebraic groups.
</li><li> Any extension of special algebraic groups is special. In particular, the groups of upper triangular matrices <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{T}_n\)</span> are special as they can be obtained via extensions from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{G}_a\)</span>.
</li><li> The group <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span> is not special, as the morphism <span class="math inline">\(\Spec k[x, x^{-1}] \to \Spec k[y, y^{-1}]\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(y = x^2\)</span> is a principal <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span>-bundle, which is not locally trivial in the Zariski topology.
