<div class="example">The category <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Set}\)</span> of sets, with either <span class="math inline">\(\sqcup\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> as tensor product, is naturally symmetric.<br/>
The category <span class="math inline">\(R\text{-}\textbf{Mod}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-modules, with either <span class="math inline">\(\oplus\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\otimes_R\)</span> as tensor product, is naturally symmetric.
</div><div class="example">The category <span class="math inline">\(R\text{-}\textbf{Bimod}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-bimodules is monoidal, with <span class="math inline">\(\otimes_R\)</span> as tensor product and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> as unital object, but not necessarily symmetric. For example, take <span class="math inline">\(R = k\)</span> a field with two non-commuting automorphisms <span class="math inline">\(\sigma, \tau\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(M = {}_1 k_\sigma\)</span> be the abelian group <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-bimodule structure given by <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot x \cdot b = ax \sigma(b)\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(N = {}_1 k_\tau\)</span> similarly. Then we have a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-bimodule isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\varphi : M \otimes_k N \xrightarrow{\sim} {}_1 k_{\sigma \tau}\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(x \otimes y \mapsto x \sigma(y)\)</span>, and similarly <span class="math inline">\(N \otimes_k M = {}_1 k_{\tau \sigma}\)</span>. If there were to exist some <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-bimodule isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi : {}_1 k_{\sigma \tau} \xrightarrow{\sim} {}_1 k_{\tau \sigma}\)</span> it would be given by <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x) = x \psi(1)\)</span> (since <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is a left <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-module isomorphism). However, as <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is a right <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-module isomorphism as well, we must have <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x) = \psi(1) \tau \sigma \tau^{-1} \sigma^{-1} (x)\)</span>, which implies that <span class="math inline">\(x = \tau \sigma \tau^{-1} \sigma^{-1} (x)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in k\)</span>, but we assumed <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> did not commute. Hence such <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> does not exist, and <span class="math inline">\(k\text{-}\textbf{Bimod}\)</span> cannot be symmetric.
</div><div class="example">A monoidal category can be symmetric in multiple ways. Let <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{GrVect}_k\)</span> be the category whose objects are graded vector spaces <span class="math inline">\(V = \oplus_{n \in \ZZ} V_n\)</span> over a field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and whose morphisms are linear maps that respect the grading. The tensor product of two graded vector spaces <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is again graded, with grading <span class="math inline">\((V \otimes W)_n = \oplus_{p + q = n} (V_p \otimes W_q)\)</span>, making <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{GrVect}_k\)</span> into a monoidal category, where the unital object is the ground field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> concentrated in degree zero.<br/>
There is more than one way to make <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{GrVect}_k\)</span> symmetric. As the map <span class="math inline">\(V \otimes W \to W \otimes V\)</span> one could take the more obvious map <span class="math inline">\(\tau : v \otimes w \to w \otimes v\)</span>. However, one could also take the map <span class="math inline">\(\kappa : v \otimes w \mapsto (-1)^{pq} w \otimes v\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(p = \deg(v)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q = \deg(w)\)</span>, known as <i>Koszulâ€™s sign change</i>. One can check that <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> indeed satisfies the axioms.
