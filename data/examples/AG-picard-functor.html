<div class="example">Note that the absolute Picard functor is generally not a <a href="#AG:sheaf">sheaf</a>. Namely, it can happen that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a scheme with non-trivial line bundle <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\{ U_i \}\)</span> an open cover such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}|_{X \times_S U_i}\)</span> is trivial for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. For example, take <span class="math inline">\(X = \PP^1_S\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{O}(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_1 = \AA^1_S, U_2 = \AA^1_S\)</span> the usual affine charts. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\textup{Pic}\)</span> is not a sheaf for the Zariski topology on <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Sch}/S\)</span>, and in particular is not <a href="#CT:representable-functor">representable</a>.
