<div class="example"><ul><li> Any <a href="#TO:discrete-topology">discrete</a> space is totally disconnected.
</li><li> The rational numbers <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span> with Euclidean topology is totally disconnected. Namely, for any <span class="math inline">\(A \subset \QQ\)</span> containing at least two distinct <span class="math inline">\(q_1, q_2 \in A\)</span>, there exists an irrational number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(q_1 < r < q_2\)</span>, so that
<span class="math display">\[ A = \{ q \in A \mid q < r \} \sqcup \{ q \in A \mid q > r \} , \]</span>
which shows <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is disconnected.
