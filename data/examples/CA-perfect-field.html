<div class="example"><ul><li> Every field of characteristic zero is perfect. Namely, if an irreducible polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> were to have a multiple root (in some field extension), then <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will have a common factor. But this cannot happen as <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is irreducible and <span class="math inline">\(\deg(f') = \deg(f) - 1\)</span>.
</li><li> Every finite field is perfect.
</li><li> Every algebraically closed field is perfect.
</li></ul>
</div><div class="example">The field <span class="math inline">\(\FF_p(t)\)</span> is not perfect: the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f = x^p - t\)</span> is irreducible, but if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a root in some field extension, we have <span class="math inline">\(x^p - t = x^p - \alpha^p = (x - \alpha)^p\)</span>, which shows <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not separable.
