<div class="example">Any strict monomorphism <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> is a <a href="#CT:monomorphism">monomorphism</a>. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta : Z \to X\)</span> are morphisms with <span class="math inline">\(f \alpha = f \beta\)</span>. Then pick <span class="math inline">\(g = f \alpha = f \beta\)</span> and note that <span class="math inline">\(xf = yf\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(xg = yg\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x, y : Y \to W\)</span>. Hence there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(h : Z \to X\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(g = fh\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> both satisfy this property, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \beta\)</span>.
