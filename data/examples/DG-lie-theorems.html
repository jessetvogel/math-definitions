<div class="example">Theorem (II) does not work if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is not simply connected. Namely, let <span class="math inline">\(G = S^1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H = \RR\)</span> whose Lie algebras are <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} = \RR\)</span> with zero Lie bracket. The identity map <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}\)</span> does not lift to a morphism of Lie groups <span class="math inline">\(G \to H\)</span>, since no such morphism exists.
