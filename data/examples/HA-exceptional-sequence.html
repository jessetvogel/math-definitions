<div class="example">For <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D} = \textbf{D}^\textup{b}(\textbf{FinVect}_k)\)</span>, the bounded derived category of finite vector spaces over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the one-dimensional vector space <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is exceptional, and moreover, it generates <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> as a triangulated category.<br/>
For general <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span>, the subcategory <span class="math inline">\(\langle E \rangle\)</span> generated by an exceptional object <span class="math inline">\(E \in \mathcal{D}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{D}^\textup{b}(\textbf{FinVect}_k)\)</span>. For example, every object in <span class="math inline">\(\langle E \rangle\)</span> is isomorphic to a direct sum of shifts of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.
