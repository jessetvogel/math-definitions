<div class="example">Consider the <a href="#TO:wedge-sum">wedge sum</a> <span class="math inline">\(S^1 \vee S^1\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(U = S^1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V = S^1\)</span> be the obvious cover of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Take as basepoint <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> the intersection of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. By the Seifert–van Kampen theorem we find that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(S^1 \vee S^1, x_0)\)</span> is the pushout of <span class="math inline">\(1 \to \ZZ\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 \to \ZZ\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(x_0, x_0) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(S^1, x_0) = \ZZ\)</span>. This pushout is <a href="#GT:free-group">free group</a> <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> on two elements.
</div><div class="example">Consider the circle <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> with two opposite basepoints <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(U, V\)</span> be two U-shaped subsets, both containing <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, covering <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>. By the Seifert–van Kampen theorem we find that <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(S^1, \{ x_0, x_1 \})\)</span> is the pushout of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{2} \to \hat{\textbf{2}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{2} \simeq \Pi(U \cap V, \{ x_0, x_1 \})\)</span> is the discrete category with two objects, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\textbf{2}} \simeq \Pi(U, \{ x_0, x_1 \}) \simeq \Pi(V, \{ x_0, x_1 \})\)</span> is the category with two objects and a single isomorphism between them. The objects of this pushout are <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, and there are isomorphisms <span class="math inline">\(f, g : x_0 \to x_1\)</span> such that all morphisms are compositions of <span class="math inline">\(f, f^{-1}, g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g^{-1}\)</span>.<br/>
In particular, the fundamental group <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(S^1, x_0) \isom \ZZ\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be any group, generated by a set of generators <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, subject to a set of relations <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> (i.e. words in elements of <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>). We can construct a space whose fundamental group is <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. First, consider the ‘bouquet of circles’ <span class="math inline">\(Y = \bigvee_{\gamma \in \Gamma} S^1\)</span> with distinguished basepoint <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Then, for each relation <span class="math inline">\(r \in R\)</span> we can construct a map <span class="math inline">\(f_r : S^1 \to Y\)</span> which travels through the circles corresponding to the letters of the word <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the space obtained by attaching a <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cells to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(f_r\)</span> for each relation <span class="math inline">\(r \in R\)</span>. We claim that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(X, y) \isom G\)</span>.<br/>
For each <span class="math inline">\(r \in R\)</span>, pick a point <span class="math inline">\(x_r\)</span> in the interior of the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cell corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(V = X - \bigcup_{r \in R} x_r\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> be the union of small disks around the <span class="math inline">\(x_r\)</span>, small enough to still be contained in the interiors of the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cells. For each <span class="math inline">\(r \in R\)</span>, pick a point <span class="math inline">\(a_r \in U \cap V\)</span> in the interior of the <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cell corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and put <span class="math inline">\(A = \{ a_r : r \in R \} \cup \{ y \}\)</span>.<br/>
Now <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> deformation retracts to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(V, V \cap A)\)</span> is equivalent (as a groupoid) to the free group <span class="math inline">\(F_\Gamma\)</span>. Furthermore, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is a union of disks, so <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(U, U \cap A)\)</span> is trivial (that is, a discrete groupoid). Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(U \cap V, U \cap V \cap A)\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\bigsqcup_{r \in R} \ZZ\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(U \cap V\)</span> deformation retracts to a disjoint union of circles. Since <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(U \cap V, U \cap V \cap A) \to \Pi(V, V \cap A)\)</span> sends the generator of the copy of <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span> corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> to the relation <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(F_\Gamma\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(X, A)\)</span> is equivalent to the group generated by <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, subject to the relations <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, that is <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(X, y) \isom G\)</span>.
