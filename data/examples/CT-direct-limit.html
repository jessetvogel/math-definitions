<div class="example">When <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is the category of sets, groups, rings or modules, a direct limit can     explicitly be described by
<span class="math display">\[ \varinjlim_{i \in I} X_i = \bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i / \sim{} , \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in X_i\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(x_j \in X_j\)</span> if and only if there exists some <span class="math inline">\(k \in I\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i, j \le k\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f_{ik}(x_i) = f_{jk}(x_j)\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> if they ‘eventually become equal’.
