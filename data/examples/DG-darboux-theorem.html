<div class="example"><div class="proof">Locally around <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we can write <span class="math inline">\(\omega = \frac{1}{2} \omega_{ij} dx^i \wedge dx^j\)</span>. Consider <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0 = \frac{1}{2} \omega_{ij}(x) dx^i \wedge dx^1\)</span>, which is also a symplectic form in the same neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Moreover, for a sufficiently small neighborhood around <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we have a family of symplectic forms
<span class="math display">\[ \omega(t) = (1 - t) \omega_0 + t \omega , \quad t \in [0, 1] . \]</span>
Since <span class="math inline">\(\omega - \omega_0\)</span> is closed, using <a href="#DG:poincare-lemma">Poincaré’s lemma</a> we can locally around <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> write <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\omega}(t) = \omega - \omega_0 = - d \lambda\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-form <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\omega - \omega_0\)</span> vanishes at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we may choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> to vanish at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> up to second order. Now let <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span> be the vector field defined by <span class="math inline">\(\iota_{X(t)} \omega(t) = \lambda\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_t\)</span> be the flow of <span class="math inline">\(X(t)\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_t(x) = x\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t \in [0, 1]\)</span>, the flow <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_t\)</span> exists on the whole interval <span class="math inline">\(t \in [0, 1]\)</span> sufficiently close to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Now,
<span class="math display">\[ \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^* \omega(t) = \varphi_t^* \left(\frac{\partial \omega(t)}{\partial t} + \mathcal{L}_{X(t)} \omega(t) \right) = \varphi_t^* \left(\frac{\partial \omega(t)}{\partial t} + d(\iota_{X(t)} \omega(t)) \right) = \varphi_t^* \left( -d \lambda + d \lambda \right) = 0 , \]</span>
using the <a href="#DG:cartan-formula">Cartan formula</a>. This implies that <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1^* \omega = \varphi_1^* \omega(1) = \varphi_0^* \omega(0) = \omega_0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span> is the desired diffeomorphism. Finally, by a linear change of variables the form <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0\)</span> can be reduced to the canonical form.
