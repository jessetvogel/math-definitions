<div class="example"><ul><li> All model categories in which all objects are fibrant are right proper. For example, the categories <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Top}\)</span> of topological spaces and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ch}_R = \textbf{Ch}_{\ge 0}(\textbf{Mod}_R)\)</span> of chain complexes of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-modules, both with their classical model structure, are right proper.
</li><li> All model categories in which all objects are cofibrant are left proper. For example, the category <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Set}_\Delta\)</span> of simplicial sets with the classical model structure is left proper. 
</li><li> The category <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Set}_\Delta\)</span> is also right proper, even though not all objects are fibrant. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Top}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ch}_R\)</span> are also left proper, even though not all their objects are cofibrant.
