<div class="example">The twisted cubic is not a complete intersection:
<span class="math display">\[ X = \textup{Proj}\left(\frac{k[x, y, z, w]}{(xw - yz, y^2 - xz, z^2 - yw)}\right) \subset \PP_k^3 \]</span>
Namely, its dimension is one, but its ideal cannot be generated by <span class="math inline">\(3 - 1 = 2\)</span> elements.
