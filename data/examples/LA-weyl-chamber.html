<div class="example">Below is depicted the root system <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>. The dotted lines are the hyperplanes which are orthogonal to the roots. The filled area is one of the Weyl chambers, corresponding to the base <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = \{ (0, 1), (\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3}, -\frac{1}{2}) \}\)</span>.

Note that the <a href="#LA:weyl-group">Weyl group</a>, in this case <span class="math inline">\(W = S_3\)</span>, acts on the set of Weyl chambers (or equivalently, on the set of bases for <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>). It is a theorem that this action is always free and transitive.
