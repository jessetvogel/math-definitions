<div class="example">If <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to S\)</span> is a semi-separated morphism with <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> affine, then intersections of open affines on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are again open affine. That is, for two open affines <span class="math inline">\(U, V \subset X\)</span>, their intersection is given by
<span class="math display">\[ U \cap V = U \times_X V = \Delta_{X/S}^{-1}(U \times_S V) , \]</span>
which is again affine open.
</div><div class="example">Any <a href="#AG:separated-morphism">separated morphism</a> is semi-separated morphism, and any semi-separated morphism is quasi-separated, but the converses do not hold.<br/>
Namely, let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the affine plane with double origin, over a field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(X \to \Spec k\)</span> is quasi-compact, but not semi-separated as the intersection of the two affine planes <span class="math inline">\(U, V \subset X\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(U \cap V = \AA^2_k \setminus \{ (0, 0) \}\)</span>, is not affine.<br/>
Furthermore, let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be the affine line with double origin, over a field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(Y \to \Spec k\)</span> is semi-separated, but not separated.
