<div class="example">Every <a href="#DG:integrable-distribution">integral distribution</a> is involutive. Indeed, at any point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> there exists an <a href="#DG:integral-submanifold">integral submanifold</a> <span class="math inline">\(i : N \to M\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(X, Y \in \Gamma(\mathcal{D})\)</span> can be viewed as vector fields on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\([X, Y]\)</span> is also a vector field on <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.<br/>
Conversely, it is a theorem by Frobenius that every involutive distribution is integrable.
