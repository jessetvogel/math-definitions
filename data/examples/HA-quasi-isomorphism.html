<div class="example">Quasi-isomorphisms are generally not invertible. For example, the morphism of complexes
<img class="display-math-svg" src="data/svg/8b09c861e52450e2a2721d51331090e1ff408cc5.svg" alt />
is a quasi-isomorphism, but not invertible.<br/>
Also there are complexes with isomorphic homology, but which are not quasi-isomorphic. For example,
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to \CC[x, y] \oplus \CC[x, y] \overset{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} \CC[x, y] \to 0 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad 0 \to \CC[x, y] \overset{0}{\longrightarrow} \CC \to 0 \]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(f, g) = xf + yg\)</span>.
