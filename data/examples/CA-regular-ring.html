<div class="example">Every field is a regular local ring: their Krull dimension is zero, and their maximal ideal is <span class="math inline">\((0)\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">The local ring <span class="math inline">\(R = k[x]/(x^2)\)</span> is not a regular local ring. Its only prime ideal is its maximal ideal <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m} = (x)/(x^2)\)</span>, so the Krull dimension is zero, but the minimal number of generators of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> is one.
