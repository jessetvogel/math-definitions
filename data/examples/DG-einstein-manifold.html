<div class="example">In general relativity, Einstein’s equation with a cosmological constant <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[ \textup{Ric} - \frac{1}{2} g R + g \Lambda = \kappa T ,
    \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the <a href="#DG:scalar-curvature">scalar curvature</a>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> the stress-energy tensor, and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4}\)</span> the gravitational constant. In particular, in a vacuum we obtain <span class="math inline">\(T = 0\)</span> and
<span class="math display">\[ \textup{Ric} = \frac{2 \Lambda}{\dim(M) - 2} g . \]</span>
Hence, the vacuum solutions of Einstein’s equation are Einstein manifolds.
