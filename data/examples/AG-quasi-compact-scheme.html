<div class="example">Any affine scheme <span class="math inline">\(X = \Spec R\)</span> is quasi-compact. Since the standard opens form a basis for the topology on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, it suffices to consider an open cover of the form <span class="math inline">\(X = \cup_{f \in S} X_f\)</span> for some subset <span class="math inline">\(S \subset R\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\{ X_f : f \in S \}\)</span> covers <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\iff\)</span> no prime ideal of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\iff\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is contained in the ideal generated by <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. In case of the latter, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is also contained in the ideal generated by some finite <span class="math inline">\(S' \subset S\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(X = \cup_{f \in S'} X_f\)</span> as well.
</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(X = \Spec k[x_1, x_2, \ldots]\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(U = X \setminus \{ (x_1, x_2, \ldots) \}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is affine, it is quasi-compact. However, <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is not quasi-compact as the cover <span class="math inline">\(\{ X_{x_i} : i = 1, 2, \ldots \}\)</span> does not admit a finite subcover. Namely, any finite subset <span class="math inline">\(\{ X_{x_{i_1}}, X_{x_{i_2}}, \ldots, X_{x_{i_n}} \}\)</span> will not cover the prime ideal <span class="math inline">\((x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \ldots, x_{i_n})\)</span>.
