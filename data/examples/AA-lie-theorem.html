<div class="example"><div class="proof">Note that it suffices to find a non-zero vector <span class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span> which is a common eigenvector to all <span class="math inline">\(\pi(g)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(g \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. Furthermore, we may assume <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> is finite-dimensional since <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> factors through <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathfrak{g})\)</span>, which is finite-dimensional and also solvable.<br/>
Proof by induction on <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathfrak{g}\)</span>, where the case <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathfrak{g} = 0\)</span> is trivial, so we may assume <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathfrak{g} > 0\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> is solvable, <span class="math inline">\([\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}] \subsetneq \mathfrak{g}\)</span>, so the quotient <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} / [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]\)</span> is abelian of dimension <span class="math inline">\(\ge 1\)</span>. Pick <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\mathfrak{h}} \subset \mathfrak{g} / [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]\)</span> any a subspace of codimension one, then it is automatically an <a href="#AA:lie-algebra-ideal">ideal</a> and its preimage <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}\)</span> is also an ideal of codimension one. Thus, we can write <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \langle a \rangle\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. Now, <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span> is also solvable, so by the induction hypothesis there exists some non-zero vector <span class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span> which is a common eigenvector to all <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathfrak{h})\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\pi(h) v = \lambda(h) v\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \in \mathfrak{h}^*\)</span>.<br/>
We claim the eigenspace <span class="math inline">\(V^\mathfrak{h}_\lambda = \{ v \in V : \pi(h) v = \lambda(h) v \textup{ for all } h \in \mathfrak{h} \}\)</span> is invariant under <span class="math inline">\(\pi(a)\)</span>. Namely, for any <span class="math inline">\(v \in V^\mathfrak{h}_\lambda\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h \in \mathfrak{h}\)</span>, we have
<span class="math display">\[ \pi(h) \pi(a) v = \pi([h, a]) v + \pi(a) \pi(h) v = \lambda([h, a]) v + \lambda(h) \pi(a) v , \]</span>
so it suffices to show that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda([h, a]) = 0\)</span>. Consider the sequence of subspaces
<span class="math display">\[ \{ 0 \} = W_{-1} \subset W_0 \subset W_1 \subset \cdots \quad \textup{ with }  W_m = \langle v, \pi(a) v, \ldots, \pi(a)^m v \rangle . \]</span>
Since <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is finite-dimensional, there exists some minimal <span class="math inline">\(N \ge 0\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(W_N = W_{N + 1}\)</span>. By induction on <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, we will show that <span class="math inline">\(W_m\)</span> is invariant under <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span>, and moreover
<span class="math display">\[ \pi(h) \pi(a)^m v - \lambda(h) \pi(a)^m v \in W_{m - 1} \quad \textup{ for all } h \in \mathfrak{h} . \]</span>
The case <span class="math inline">\(m = 0\)</span> is trivial, and for <span class="math inline">\(m > 0\)</span> we find
<span class="math display">\[ \pi(h)\pi(a)^m v - \lambda(h) \pi(a)^m v = [\pi(h), \pi(a)] \pi(a)^{m - 1} v + \pi(a) \left( \pi(h) \pi(a)^{m - 1} v - \lambda(h) \pi(a)^{m - 1} v \right) \in W_{m - 1} \]</span>
because of <span class="math inline">\([\pi(h), \pi(a)] \in \pi(\mathfrak{h})\)</span> and the induction hypothesis. Now, <span class="math inline">\(W_N\)</span> is invariant under <span class="math inline">\(\pi(a)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathfrak{h})\)</span>, and in terms of the basis <span class="math inline">\(\{ v, \pi(a) v, \ldots, \pi(a)^N v \}\)</span>, any <span class="math inline">\(\pi(h)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(h \in \mathfrak{h}\)</span> acts on <span class="math inline">\(W_N\)</span> by an upper triangular matrix with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda(h)\)</span> all over the diagonal. Hence,
<span class="math display">\[ 0 = \tr_{W_N}([\pi(h), \pi(a)]) = \tr_{W_N}(\pi([h, a])) = (N + 1) \lambda([h, a]) , \]</span>
so <span class="math inline">\(\lambda([h, a]) = 0\)</span>, which shows that <span class="math inline">\(V^\mathfrak{h}_\lambda\)</span> is invariant under <span class="math inline">\(\pi(a)\)</span>.<br/>
As <span class="math inline">\(\CC\)</span> is algebraically closed, there exists some non-zero <span class="math inline">\(v \in V^\mathfrak{h}_\lambda\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi(a) v = \ell a\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\ell \in \CC\)</span>. Now define <span class="math inline">\(\lambda' \in \mathfrak{g}^*\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\lambda'(h + \mu a) = \lambda(h) + \mu \ell\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(h \in \mathfrak{h}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu \in \CC\)</span>. Then by construction <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is an eigenvector to all of <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathfrak{g})\)</span>.
