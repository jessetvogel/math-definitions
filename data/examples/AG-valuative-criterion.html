<div class="example">The valuative criterion for properness can be used to show that the morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : \AA^1_k \to \Spec k\)</span> is not proper. Namely, take <span class="math inline">\(R = k[t]_{(t)}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(K = k(t)\)</span>. Considering the diagram with <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1_k \to \Spec K\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(k[x] \to k(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto 1/t\)</span>, there does not exist a map <span class="math inline">\(k[x] \to k[t]_{(t)}\)</span> completing the diagram.
</div><div class="example">The valuative criterion for properness can be used to show that the morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : \PP^n \to \Spec \ZZ\)</span> is proper. It can be assumed that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a discrete valuation ring. A morphism <span class="math inline">\(\Spec K \to \PP^n\)</span> can be expressed in terms of homogeneous coordinates <span class="math inline">\((a_0 : a_1 : \ldots : a_n)\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in K\)</span> not all zero. Let <span class="math inline">\(a_\textup{min} = \min \{ a_i : 1 \le i \le n, a_i \ne 0 \}\)</span> with respect to the valuation of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Then the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-point of <span class="math inline">\(\PP^n\)</span> we are looking for is given by
<span class="math display">\[ \left( \frac{a_0}{a_\textup{min}} : \frac{a_1}{a_\textup{min}} : \ldots : \frac{a_n}{a_\textup{min}} \right) . \]</span>
Indeed, we have <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a_i}{a_\textup{min}} \in R\)</span> since the valuation is positive, and the coordinates do not vanish simultaneously, since in particular <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a_\textup{min}}{a_\textup{min}} = 1\)</span>.<br/>
Moreover, since being proper is stable under base change, this shows <span class="math inline">\(\PP^n_X \to X\)</span> is proper for all base schemes <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.
