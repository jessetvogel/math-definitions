<div class="example">The condition ‘directed’ is necessary, since the colimit of the diagram
<span class="math display">\[ \ZZ \xleftarrow{\cdot 2} \ZZ \xrightarrow{\cdot 2} \ZZ \]</span>
is <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ^3 / ((1, 0, -2), (1, -2, 0))\)</span>, which has torsion (e.g. <span class="math inline">\((1, -1, -1)\)</span>), so is not flat.
