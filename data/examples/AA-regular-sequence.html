<div class="example">Consider <span class="math inline">\(R = k[x, y]\)</span> and the sequence <span class="math inline">\((xy, x^2)\)</span>. This sequence is not regular, since <span class="math inline">\(x^2 \cdot y = 0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\QQ[x, y] / (xy)\)</span>, although <span class="math inline">\(y \ne 0\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">Consider <span class="math inline">\(R = k[x, y, z]\)</span> and the sequence <span class="math inline">\((x, y(1 - x), z(1 - x))\)</span>. This sequence is regular since
<span class="math display">\[ y(1 - x) = y \in k[x, y, z]/(x) = k[y, z] \quad \text{ and } \quad z(1 - x) = z \in k[x, y, z]/(x, y - xy) = k[z] \]</span>
are both non-zero-divisors.<br/>
However, note that the order matters as <span class="math inline">\((y(1 - x), z(1 - x), x)\)</span> is not a regular sequence. Namely, <span class="math inline">\(z(1 - x) \cdot y = 0 \in k[x, y, z] / (y(1 - x))\)</span> even though <span class="math inline">\(y \ne 0\)</span>.
