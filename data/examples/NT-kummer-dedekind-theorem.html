<div class="example">Consider <span class="math inline">\(f = x^3 + x + 1\)</span> with factorizations
<span class="math display">\[ f \mod 2 = x^3 + x + 1 \quad \textup{ and } \quad f \mod 3 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x - 1) . \]</span>
This shows that <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is inert in <span class="math inline">\(R = \ZZ[\alpha] = \ZZ[x] / (f)\)</span>, and that <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> splits into the prime ideals <span class="math inline">\((3, \alpha - 1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((3, \alpha^2 + \alpha - 1)\)</span>.<br/>
If <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f} = f \mod p\)</span> has a factor with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(e_i > 1\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(p > 3\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f' = 3x^2 + 1\)</span> should have a common factor modulo <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and this factor must be <span class="math inline">\(f - \tfrac{1}{3} x f' = \tfrac{2}{3} x + 1\)</span>, which has root <span class="math inline">\(x = - \tfrac{3}{2}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(f'(-\tfrac{3}{2}) \mod p = \tfrac{31}{4} \mod p\)</span>, this can only be the case for <span class="math inline">\(p = 31\)</span>. Indeed, <span class="math inline">\(f \mod 31 = (x - 14)^2 (x - 3)\)</span>. Now, the remainder of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> upon division by <span class="math inline">\(x - 14\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(r = f(14) = 2759 = 31 \cdot 89\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(31^2\)</span> does not divide <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, we find that the prime <span class="math inline">\((31, \alpha - 14)\)</span> is regular. It follows that all primes of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> are regular, so <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a Dedekind domain. Furthermore, the prime <span class="math inline">\(31\)</span>, which factors as
<span class="math display">\[ 31 R = (31, \alpha - 14)^2 (31, \alpha - 3) \]</span>
in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, is the only prime which ramifies in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.
