<div class="example">Every ideal <span class="math inline">\(I \subsetneq R\)</span> is contained in some maximal ideal <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>. Namely, consider the partially ordered set <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of ideals <span class="math inline">\(J \subsetneq R\)</span> containing <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, ordered by inclusion. Then <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is non-empty as it contains <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, and every chain <span class="math inline">\(J_1 \subset J_2 \subset \ldots\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has an upper bound <span class="math inline">\(J = \cup_{i \ge 1} J_i\)</span>. Note that indeed <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is an ideal, and <span class="math inline">\(J \ne R\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(1 \not\in J\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(1 \not\in J_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.
Now from <a href="#GM:zorns-lemma">Zornâ€™s lemma</a> it follows <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a maximal element, which corresponds to a maximal ideal <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> containing <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.
