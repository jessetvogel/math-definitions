<div class="example">The complex
<span class="math display">\[ \cdots \to 0 \to \ZZ \xrightarrow{\id} \ZZ \to 0 \to \cdots \]</span>
is contractible, which follows from taking <span class="math inline">\(k^0 : \ZZ \to \ZZ\)</span> to be the identity.<br/>
Note that any contractible complex has zero <a href="#HA:homology-object">homology</a>, since homotopy equivalences preserve homology. However, not every complex with zero homology is contractible. Namely, the complex
<span class="math display">\[ \cdots \to 0 \to \ZZ \xrightarrow{\cdot 2} \ZZ \to \ZZ / 2\ZZ \to 0 \to \cdots \]</span>
has zero homology, but is not contractible since the sequence does not split.
