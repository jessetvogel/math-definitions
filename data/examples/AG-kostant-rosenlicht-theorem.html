<div class="example"><div class="proof">Let <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> be an orbit of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Replacing <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with the closure of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, we may assume that <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is dense in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. The closed complement <span class="math inline">\(Z = X \setminus O\)</span> is not equal to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(O \ne \varnothing\)</span>, so the ideal <span class="math inline">\(I(Z)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(X)\)</span> is nonzero. As <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is stable under <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, so is the ideal <span class="math inline">\(I(Z)\)</span>, and because <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is unipotent, there exists a nonzero <span class="math inline">\(f \in I(Z)^G\)</span>. Because <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is fixed by <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, it is constant on <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, and by continuity also on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(I(Z)\)</span> contains a nonzero constant, so <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is empty, and it follows that <span class="math inline">\(O = X\)</span> is closed.

</div><div class="example">Consider the unipotent group <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{U}_2(k) = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \;:\; a \in k \right\}\)</span> acting on the affine plane <span class="math inline">\(\AA^2_k\)</span> via
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x + ay \\ y \end{pmatrix} . \]</span>
Then the orbits are given by the points <span class="math inline">\((x, 0)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x \in k\)</span> and the lines <span class="math inline">\(L_y = \{ (x, y) \;:\; x \in k \}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y \ne 0\)</span>, all of which are indeed closed.
