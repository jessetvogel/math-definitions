<div class="example">The categories <b>Set</b>, <b>Group</b>, <b>Ring</b>, <b>Top</b> are all concrete, where the forgetful functor <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the functor that maps an object to its underlying set.<br/>
However, the category <b>hTop</b> of topological spaces where morphisms are <a href="#AT:homotopy">homotopy</a> classes of continuous maps, is not concrete. The obvious forgetful functor <span class="math inline">\(U : \textbf{hTop} \to \textbf{Set}\)</span> is not faithful, since homotopic maps need not be equal. Moreover, it is proven that <b>hTop</b> cannot be made into a concrete category.
