<div class="example"><ul><li> Every algebraic extension <span class="math inline">\(\ell/k\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{char} k = 0\)</span> is separable. Namely, take any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \ell\)</span> with minimal polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f \in k[x]\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> were to be inseparable, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and its derivative <span class="math inline">\(f' \ne 0\)</span> would have a common factor of degree <span class="math inline">\(\ge 1\)</span>, contradicting the irreducibility of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. 
</li><li> Every algebraic extension <span class="math inline">\(\ell/k\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(k = \FF_p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> prime is separable. Namely, every such algebraic extensions is of the form <span class="math inline">\(\ell = \FF_{p^n}\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 1\)</span>. Write <span class="math inline">\(\ell = k(\alpha)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \ell\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{p^n} = 1\)</span>, the minimal polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> must divide <span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - 1\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(x^{p^n} - 1\)</span> has no multiple roots (its derivative is <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>), neither has the minimal polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and thus it must be separable.

</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(k = \FF_p(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ell = k[X] / (X^p - t) = \FF_p(\sqrt[p](t))\)</span>, for some prime number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The minimal polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt[p](t)\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(f = x^p - t\)</span>, which over <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> factors as <span class="math inline">\((x - \sqrt[p]{t})^p\)</span>, showing that <span class="math inline">\(\ell/k\)</span> is not separable.
