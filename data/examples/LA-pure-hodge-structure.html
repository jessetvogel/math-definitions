<div class="example">For any <span class="math inline">\(H_\ZZ\)</span>, taking <span class="math inline">\(H^{k,k} = H_\CC\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H^{p, q} = 0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\((p, q) \ne (k, k)\)</span> gives the <i>trivial Hodge structure</i> of weight <span class="math inline">\(2k\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">Take <span class="math inline">\(H_\ZZ = 2 \pi i \ZZ \subset \CC\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_\CC = H^{-1, -1}\)</span>.
