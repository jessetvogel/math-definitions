<div class="example">For an algebraic group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the quotient stack <span class="math inline">\(\textup{B}G = [\Spec(k) / G]\)</span> is called the <i>classifying stack</i> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, as it parameterizes principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundles: for any scheme <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(\Hom_{\textbf{Stck}}(T, \textup{B}G)\)</span> is the groupoid of principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundles over <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.
