<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(X = \AA^n - \{ 0 \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G = \mathbb{G}_m\)</span> act on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by scaling the coordinates. Then the map <span class="math inline">\(\pi : \AA^n - \{ 0 \} \to \PP^{n - 1}\)</span> is a geometric quotient.<br/>
If we instead take <span class="math inline">\(X = \AA^n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(G = \mathbb{G}_m\)</span> acting on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by scaling the coordinates, then the map <span class="math inline">\(\pi' : \AA^n \to \{ \star \}\)</span> is a <a href="#AG:categorical-quotient">categorical quotient</a>, but not a geometric quotient: the only geometric fiber of <span class="math inline">\(\pi'\)</span> is the whole of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, but this is not the orbit of any geometric point of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. To be more precise, the image of <span class="math inline">\(\Psi : (g, x) \mapsto (g \cdot x, x)\)</span> is not the whole of <span class="math inline">\(\AA^n \times \AA^n\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">A geometric quotient <span class="math inline">\(\pi : X \to Y\)</span> is a <a href="#AG:categorical-quotient">categorical quotient</a>. Namely, let <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Z\)</span> be an <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-morphism with <span class="math inline">\(f \circ \sigma = f \circ p_2\)</span>. The goal is to construct a morphism <span class="math inline">\(g : Y \to Z\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f = g \circ \pi\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\{ V_i \}\)</span> be an affine open covering of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(V_i)\)</span> is an invariant open subset of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, so by condition (ii), <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(V_i) = \pi^{-1}(U_i)\)</span> for <i>some</i> subset <span class="math inline">\(U_i \subset Y\)</span>. But then <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is open by (iii), and since <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is surjective, <span class="math inline">\(\{ U_i \}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Now note that any morphism <span class="math inline">\(g : Y \to Z\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f = g \circ \pi\)</span> must satisfy <span class="math inline">\(g(U_i) \subset V_i\)</span>. Hence it must be defined by a set of (compatible) morphisms <span class="math inline">\(h_i : \mathcal{O}_Z(V_i) \to \mathcal{O}_Y(U_i)\)</span> such that

commutes. Since <span class="math inline">\(\pi^*\)</span> is injective by (iv), the <span class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> are unique if they exist. Well, for any <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_Z(V_i)\)</span> we have that <span class="math inline">\(\pi^*(\alpha)\)</span> is an invariant element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(\pi^{-1}(U_i))\)</span> in the sense of (iv), hence it lies in the subring <span class="math inline">\(\pi^*(\mathcal{O}_Y(U_i))\)</span>, so such <span class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> exist.
It remains to check that the <span class="math inline">\(h_i\)</span> agree on overlaps, so that they indeed glue to the desired <span class="math inline">\(g : Y \to Z\)</span>.
