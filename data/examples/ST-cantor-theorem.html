<div class="example"><div class="proof">Suppose for a contradiction that <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to P(A)\)</span> is a surjective function, and let <span class="math inline">\(S = \{ x \in A \mid x \not\in f(x) \}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is surjective, there exists some <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = S\)</span>. But now, by definition of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[ x \in S \iff x \not\in f(x) = S , \]</span>
which is a contradiction.
