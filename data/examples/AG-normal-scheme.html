<div class="example">The cusp <span class="math inline">\(C = \Spec k[x, y] / (x^3 - y^2)\)</span> is not normal since <span class="math inline">\(k[x, y] / (x^3 - y^2)\)</span> is not integrally closed: the element <span class="math inline">\(t = y/x\)</span> is integral, as <span class="math inline">\(t^2 = x\)</span>, but does not lie in <span class="math inline">\(k[x, y] / (x^3 - y^2)\)</span>.<br/>
Adding this element gives
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned}
        k[x, y, y/x] / (x^3 - y^2) &\isom k[t] \\
        x &\mapsto t^2 \\
        y &\mapsto t^3
    \end{aligned} \]</span>
which is integrally closed. This is the <i>normalization</i> of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>

</div><div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a field with <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{char}(k) \ne 2\)</span>, and consider <span class="math inline">\(X = \Spec k[x, y, z] / (z^2 - xy)\)</span>. To show <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a normal scheme, we will prove the ring <span class="math inline">\(R = k[x, y, z] / (z^2 - xy)\)</span> is an integrally closed domain. First of all, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a domain because <span class="math inline">\(z^2 - xy\)</span> is irreducible in <span class="math inline">\(k[x, y, z]\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, the field of fractions of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, is a field extension of <span class="math inline">\(k(x, y)\)</span> of degree <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Take any element <span class="math inline">\(f = \alpha + \beta z \in K\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \beta \in k(x, y)\)</span>, and assume <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is integral over <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. If the minimal polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is linear, then <span class="math inline">\(f \in R\)</span> and we are done. Otherwise, note that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(f^2 - 2 \alpha f + (\alpha - \beta^2 xy) = 0\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(X^2 - 2 \alpha X + (\alpha^2 - \beta^2 xy)\)</span> must be the minimal polynomial of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and hence the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(-2 \alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^2 - \beta^2 xy\)</span> lie in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is invertible in <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, it follows that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^2 xy \in R\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span> is squarefree, we must have <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in R\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f = \alpha + \beta z \in R\)</span>, and we conclude that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is integrally closed.
