<div class="example">Consider the category of <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological spaces</a> over the category of sets via the forgetful functor <span class="math inline">\(F : \textbf{Top} \to \textbf{Set}\)</span>. Then the strongly cartesian morphisms in <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Top}\)</span> are the morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f : Y \to X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has the <a href="#TO:pullback-topology">pullback topology</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{T}_Y = \{ f^{-1}(U) \;:\; U \subset X \textup{ open} \}\)</span>.<br/>
To show this, we need to consider the map
<span class="math display">\[ \begin{aligned}
        \varphi : \{ g : Z \to Y \} &\to \{ (h : Z \to X, j : F(Z) \to F(Y)) \mid F(h) = F(f) \circ j \} \\
        g \mapsto (f \circ g, F(g)) .
    \end{aligned} \]</span>
Note that the map <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is always injective since <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is <a href="#CT:faithful-functor">faithful</a>. Now suppose that <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has the pullback topology, and let <span class="math inline">\(h : Z \to X\)</span> be a continuous map and <span class="math inline">\(j : F(Z) \to F(Y)\)</span> a map of sets such that <span class="math inline">\(F(h) = F(f) \circ j\)</span>. Every open <span class="math inline">\(V \subset Y\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(V = f^{-1}(U)\)</span> for some open <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(j^{-1}(V) = j^{-1}(f^{-1}(U)) = h^{-1}(U)\)</span> is open as <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is continuous. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is continuous and thus <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is surjective.<br/>
Conversely, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is surjective. Let <span class="math inline">\(Y'\)</span> denote the topological space with underlying set <span class="math inline">\(F(Y)\)</span> and the pullback topology induced by <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Furthermore, let <span class="math inline">\(j : F(Y') \to F(Y)\)</span> be the identity map, and note that the composition <span class="math inline">\(F(f) \circ j\)</span> is continuous as a map <span class="math inline">\(Y' \to X\)</span>. Surjectivity of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is continuous. The inverse <span class="math inline">\(j^{-1}\)</span> is also continuous as <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous, so it follows that <span class="math inline">\(Y' = Y\)</span>.
