<div class="example"><div class="proof">Consider the statement that every injective polynomial function <span class="math inline">\(f : k^n \to k^n\)</span> is also surjective, for some field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For finite fields <span class="math inline">\(k = \FF_q\)</span> this statement is clearly true. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(k = \overline{\FF}_p = \bigcup_{m \ge 0} \FF_{p^m}\)</span> and such an <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not surjective, i.e. <span class="math inline">\((x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \overline{\FF}_p\)</span> is not in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Then we can restrict <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to the finite subfield of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\FF}_p\)</span> generated by the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and the coefficients of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to see that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must be surjective after all, that is, <span class="math inline">\((x_1, \ldots, x_n)\)</span> is in the image of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, a contradiction. Finally, from the <a href="#LO:lefschetz-principle">Lefschetz principle</a> it follows that the statement is also true for <span class="math inline">\(k = \CC\)</span>.
