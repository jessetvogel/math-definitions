<div class="example"><a href="#CT:limit">Limits</a> (and colimits) can be expressed in terms of Kan extensions. The limit of a functor <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F} : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\textup{Ran}_K F\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(K : \mathcal{C} \to 1\)</span> is the (unique) functor from <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, the category with one object and one morphism. Similarly, the colimit <span class="math inline">\(\textup{colim } F\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\textup{Lan}_K F\)</span>.
