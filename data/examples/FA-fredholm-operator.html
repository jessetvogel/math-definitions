<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> be a Hilbert space with orthonormal basis <span class="math inline">\((e_n)_{n \in \NN}\)</span>. The right shift operator <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> defined by
<span class="math display">\[ S(e_n) = e_{n + 1}, \quad \textup{ for } n \ge 0 , \]</span>
has <span class="math inline">\(\ker S = \{ 0 \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{coker} S \simeq \langle e_0 \rangle\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a Fredholm operator with index <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. The powers <span class="math inline">\(S^k\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 0\)</span> are also Fredholm with index <span class="math inline">\(-k\)</span>.<br/>
Similarly, the adjoint <span class="math inline">\(S^*\)</span>, the left shift operator,
<span class="math display">\[ S^*(e_0) = 0 \text{ and } S^*(e_{n + 1}) = e_n, \quad \textup { for } n \ge 0 , \]</span>
is Fredholm with index <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.
</div><div class="example">Sometimes Fredholm operators are required to have a closed range, but this additional condition redundant. Namely, since the cokernel of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is finite-dimensional, the image <span class="math inline">\(\im T\)</span> has a closed complement <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. The map
<span class="math display">\[ S : (X / \ker T) \oplus C \to Y, \quad (x, c) \mapsto T(x) + c \]</span>
is a bounded linear isomorphism, and thus by the <a href="#FA:open-mapping-theorem">open mapping theorem</a> <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a topological isomorphism. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\im T = S((X / \ker T) \oplus \{ 0 \})\)</span> is closed.
