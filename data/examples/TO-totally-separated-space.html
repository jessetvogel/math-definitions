<div class="example">Any <a href="#TO:totally-disconnected-space">totally disconnected space</a> is totally separated, but the converse does not hold. Namely, let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the <a href="#TO:quotient-topology">quotient</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\QQ \sqcup \QQ\)</span> (with Euclidean topology) by <span class="math inline">\(\QQ \setminus \{ 0 \}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is totally disconnected, but considering the two copies of zero, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not totally separated.
