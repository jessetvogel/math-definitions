<div class="example">The Frobenius morphism need not always be surjective. Let <span class="math inline">\(K = \FF_p(T)\)</span> the field of rational functions with coefficients in <span class="math inline">\(\FF_p\)</span>. Using that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a homomorphism fixing <span class="math inline">\(\FF_p\)</span>, we find that <span class="math inline">\(F(f(T)) = f(T^p)\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(f(T) \in K\)</span>. Hence the image of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> consists of all rational functions in <span class="math inline">\(T^p\)</span> with coefficients in <span class="math inline">\(\FF_p\)</span>. In particular, <span class="math inline">\(T \not\in \im F\)</span>.
