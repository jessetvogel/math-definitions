<div class="example">The polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f = 3x^4 + 5x \in \ZZ[x]\)</span> is primitive since <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(3, 5) = 1\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(g = 2x^3 + 4 \in \ZZ[x]\)</span> is not as <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(2, 4) = 2\)</span>. However, both <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are primitive in <span class="math inline">\(\QQ[x]\)</span>.
