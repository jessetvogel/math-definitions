<div class="example"><div class="proof"><span class="math inline">\((\Rightarrow)\)</span> After a base change to an algebraically closed field, one can apply <a href="#AA:lie-theorem">Lieâ€™s theorem</a> to obtain a basis of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> consists of upper triangular matrices, and hence <span class="math inline">\([\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]\)</span> of strictly upper triangular matrices. Then it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(\tr(xy) = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \in [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span> is also strictly upper triangular.<br/>
<span class="math inline">\((\Leftarrow)\)</span> I will try to prove this sometime.     </div>
