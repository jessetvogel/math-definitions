<div class="example">For a closed subvariety <span class="math inline">\(Z \subset X\)</span> with complement <span class="math inline">\(U = X \backslash Z\)</span>, there is a long exact sequence of mixed Hodge structures
<span class="math display">\[ \cdots \to H_c^i(U, \CC) \to H_c^i(X, \CC) \to H_c^i(Z, \CC) \to H_c^{i + 1}(U, \CC) \to \cdots \]</span>
which shows that
<span class="math display">\[ e(X) = e(Z) + e(U) . \]</span>
Moreover, it can be shown that <span class="math inline">\(e(X \times_\CC Y) = e(X) e(Y)\)</span>. This shows that <span class="math inline">\(e : \textbf{Var}_\CC \to \ZZ[u, v]\)</span> factors through the <a href="#AG:grothendieck-ring-of-varieties">Grothendieck ring of varieties</a>.
