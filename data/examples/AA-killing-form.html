<div class="example">The Killing form is symmetric,
<span class="math display">\[ \kappa_\mathfrak{g}(x, y) = \kappa_\mathfrak{g}(y, x) , \]</span>
since the trace is cyclic. Also the Killing form is associative,
<span class="math display">\[ \kappa_\mathfrak{g}([x, y], z) = \kappa_\mathfrak{g}(x, [y, z]) , \]</span>
using <span class="math inline">\(\textup{ad}_\mathfrak{g}([x, y]) = [\textup{ad}_\mathfrak{g}(x), \textup{ad}_\mathfrak{g}(y)]\)</span> and the cyclic property of the trace.
