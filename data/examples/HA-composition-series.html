<div class="example">The <b>Jordan–Hölder theorem</b> states that if an object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has two composition series
<span class="math display">\[ 0 = A_0 \subsetneq A_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq A_n = A \qquad \text{and} \qquad 0 = B_0 \subsetneq B_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq B_m = A , \]</span>
then <span class="math inline">\(m = n\)</span> and the composition factors <span class="math inline">\(A_i/A_{i - 1}\)</span> are isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(B_i/B_{i - 1}\)</span> up to permutation.<br/>
To prove this, let <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> be the smallest index such that <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \subset B_j\)</span>. Then the map <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \to B_j/B_{j - 1}\)</span> must be an isomorphism. Namely, it is surjective as its image is non-zero (since <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \nsubseteq B_{j - 1}\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(B_j/B_{j - 1}\)</span> is simple. Furthermore, it is injective since its kernel is a proper subobject of <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, and thus zero since <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is simple. Now, the quotient <span class="math inline">\(A/A_1 = A_n/A_1 = B_m/A_1\)</span> has the two filtrations
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \subsetneq A_2/A_1 \subsetneq A_3/A_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq A_n/A_1 \]</span>
and
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \subsetneq (B_1 + A_1)/A_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq (B_{j - 1} + A_1)/A_1 = B_j/A_1 \subsetneq B_{j + 1}/A_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq B_m/A_1 \]</span>
and the result follows from induction.
