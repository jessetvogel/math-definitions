<div class="example">The universal (double) cover of the <a href="#LA:orthogonal-group">special orthogonal group</a> <span class="math inline">\(\textup{SO}(3)\)</span> is the <a href="#LA:unitary-group">special unitary group</a> <span class="math inline">\(\textup{SU}(2)\)</span>. Hence, any representation <span class="math inline">\(\rho : \textup{SU}(2) \to \textup{GL}(V)\)</span> descends to a projective representation <span class="math inline">\(\pi : \textup{SO}(3) \to \textup{PGL}(V)\)</span>, which can be lifted to an honest representation if and only if the dimension of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is odd. For example, the standard representation <span class="math inline">\(\textup{SU}(2) \to \textup{GL}(\CC^2)\)</span> induces a projective representation
<span class="math display">\[ \textup{SO}(3) \to \textup{PGL}(\CC^2) \]</span>
which cannot be lifted to an honest representation.
