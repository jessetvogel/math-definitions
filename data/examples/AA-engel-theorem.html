<div class="example"><div class="proof">By induction on <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathfrak{g} = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} = \langle g \rangle\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(g \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(n > 0\)</span> be such that <span class="math inline">\(g^n \ne 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g^{n + 1} = 0\)</span>, then any non-zero vector <span class="math inline">\(v \in g^n V \ne 0\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} v = 0\)</span> by construction.<br/>
Now assume <span class="math inline">\(\dim \mathfrak{g} \ge 2\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}\)</span> be a maximal proper subalgebra, which exists as <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> is finite-dimensional. Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span> is a subalgebra, the adjoint representation induces a representation <span class="math inline">\(\pi : \mathfrak{h} \to \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h})\)</span>. Now <span class="math inline">\(\dim \pi(\mathfrak{h}) \le \dim \mathfrak{h} < \dim \mathfrak{g}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathfrak{h})\)</span> consists of nilpotent operators as well, so we may apply the induction hypothesis to obtain a non-zero <span class="math inline">\(\overline{a} \in \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\mathfrak{h}) \overline{a} = 0\)</span>. Take any lift <span class="math inline">\(a \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{a}\)</span>, and note that <span class="math inline">\([\mathfrak{h}, a] \subset \mathfrak{h}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\overline{a} \ne 0\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(a \not\in \mathfrak{h}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h} \oplus \langle a \rangle\)</span> is a larger subalgebra than <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span>, and by maximality of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span> we must have <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{h} \oplus \langle a \rangle\)</span>. In particular, <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span> is an ideal in <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> of codimension <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.<br/>
By the induction hypothesis, there exists some non-zero <span class="math inline">\(v \in V\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h} v = 0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(W = \{ v \in V : \mathfrak{h} v = 0 \}\)</span> is non-empty. Moreover, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is invariant under <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(hgw = [h, g]w + ghw = 0 + 0 = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(w \in W\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h \in \mathfrak{h}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. Using that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is nilpotent, there exists some non-zero <span class="math inline">\(w \in W\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(aw = 0\)</span>. Now <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h} w = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(aw = 0\)</span> imply <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g} w = 0\)</span> as desired.

</div><div class="example">Engel’s theorem implies that a finite-dimensional Lie algebra <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> is <a href="#AA:nilpotent-lie-algebra">nilpotent</a> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\textup{ad}_g\)</span> is nilpotent for all <span class="math inline">\(g \in \mathfrak{g}\)</span>. Namely, the ‘only if’ part is obvious, and if all <span class="math inline">\(\textup{ad}_g\)</span> are nilpotent, then Engel’s theorem can be applied to the faithful representation <span class="math inline">\(\textup{ad} : \mathfrak{g}/Z(\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g})\)</span> to give a basis for <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}/Z(\mathfrak{g})\)</span> consists of strictly upper triangular matrices. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}/Z(\mathfrak{g})\)</span> is nilpotent, and so is <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span>.
