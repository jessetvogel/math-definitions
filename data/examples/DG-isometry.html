<div class="example">Every isometry is a local isometry, but not conversely. Namely, if <span class="math inline">\(M = \RR^1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M' = S^1 \subset \RR^2\)</span> with the natural Euclidean metrics, then the map <span class="math inline">\(\RR \to S^1\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto (\cos(x), \sin(x))\)</span> is a local isometry, but not an isometry since it is not a diffeomorphism.
