<div class="example"><div class="proof">Take <span class="math inline">\(S^{2n} = \{ x \in \RR^{2n + 1} : |x|^{2n} = 1 \}\)</span>, and suppose that there exists a non-vanishing vector field <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(S^{2n}\)</span>. Viewing <span class="math inline">\(v(x) \in T_x S^{2n} \subset \RR^{2n + 1}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(v(x) \perp x\)</span>, and after rescaling we can assume <span class="math inline">\(v(x)\)</span> has unit length. Now consider the homotopy
<span class="math display">\[ H : S^{2n} \times [0, 1] \to S^{2n}, \quad (x, t) \mapsto \cos(t) x + \sin(t) v(x) , \]</span>
and note that <span class="math inline">\(H(-, 0) = \id_{S^{2n}}\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(H(-, 1) = -\id_{S^{2n}}\)</span>. However, since <span class="math inline">\(\id_{S^{2n}}\)</span> has degree <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> while the antipodal map <span class="math inline">\(-\id_{S^{2n}}\)</span> has degree <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, no such homotopy can exist, and thus no such vector field <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> can exist.
