<div class="example">There are implications
<span class="math display">\[ \textup{H-projective} \Rightarrow \textup{bundle-projective} \Rightarrow \textup{projective} \Rightarrow \textup{locally projective} \]</span>
but the converses do not hold.
<ul><li> Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a field. The obvious morphism <span class="math inline">\(\bigsqcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} \PP^n_k \to \bigsqcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} \Spec k\)</span> is bundle-projective but not H-projective.
</li><li> Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the affine line over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> with infinitely many origins. The morphism <span class="math inline">\(\bigsqcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} \PP^n_k \to X\)</span> which sends <span class="math inline">\(\PP^n_k\)</span> to the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th origin is projective but not bundle-projective.
</li><li> There are examples of morphisms which are locally projective but not projective.
