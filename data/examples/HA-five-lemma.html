<div class="example"><div class="proof"><ul><li> Take any <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \in \ker c\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(dh(\gamma) = h'c(\gamma) = 0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(h(\gamma) = 0\)</span> by injectivity of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and thus we can write <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = g(\beta)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in B\)</span>. Now, <span class="math inline">\(g'b(\beta) = cg(\beta) = c(\gamma) = 0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(b(\beta) \in \ker g' = \im f'\)</span>, and thus we can write <span class="math inline">\(b(\beta) = f'(\alpha')\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\alpha' \in A'\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is surjective, we have <span class="math inline">\(\alpha' = a(\alpha)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in A\)</span>. Now <span class="math inline">\(b(f(\alpha)) = f'a(\alpha) = f(\alpha') = b(\beta)\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f(\alpha) = \beta\)</span> by injectivity of <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = gf(\alpha) = 0\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is injective.
