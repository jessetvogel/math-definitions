<div class="example">Any Zariski, Ã©tale, smooth or syntomic covering is an fppf covering.
</div><div class="example">Consider the following cover of the affine line <span class="math inline">\(\AA^1_k\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[ \left\{ \AA^1_k - \{ 0 \} \to \AA^1_k, \qquad \Spec(\mathcal{O}_{\AA^1_k, 0}) \to \AA^1_k \right\} . \]</span>
It is not an fppf covering since the second morphism is not locally of finite presentation.<br/>
(However, it is an <a href="#AG:fpqc-covering">fpqc covering</a>.)
