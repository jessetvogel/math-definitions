<div class="example"><ul><li> Any representation of <span class="math inline">\(G = \text{GL}_1(\CC) = \CC^*\)</span> is a direct sum of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-dimensional representations of the form <span class="math inline">\(\rho_n : \CC^* \to \CC^*, z \mapsto z^n\)</span> for some character <span class="math inline">\(n \in \ZZ\)</span>. Hence the representation ring of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(R_\CC(G) = \ZZ[t, t^{-1}]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\rho_1\)</span>.<br/>
</li><li> Any representation of the cyclic group <span class="math inline">\(G = \ZZ/n\ZZ\)</span> is a direct sum of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-dimensional representations which sends <span class="math inline">\(1 \text{ mod } n\)</span> to an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root of unity. Hence the (complex) representation ring of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(R_\CC(G) = \ZZ[t]/(t^n - 1)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> corresponds to the representation <span class="math inline">\(1 \mapsto \zeta_n\)</span>, a primitive root of unity.
