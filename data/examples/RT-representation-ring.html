<div class="example"><ul><li> Any representation of <span class="math inline">\(G = \textup{GL}_1(\CC) = \CC^*\)</span> is a direct sum of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-dimensional representations of the form <span class="math inline">\(\rho_n : \CC^* \to \CC^*, z \mapsto z^n\)</span> for some character <span class="math inline">\(n \in \ZZ\)</span>. Hence the representation ring of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(R_\CC(G) = \ZZ[t, t^{-1}]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\rho_1\)</span>.<br/>
</li><li> Any representation of the cyclic group <span class="math inline">\(G = \ZZ/n\ZZ\)</span> is a direct sum of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-dimensional representations which sends <span class="math inline">\(1 \textup{ mod } n\)</span> to an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th root of unity. Hence the (complex) representation ring of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(R_\CC(G) = \ZZ[t]/(t^n - 1)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> corresponds to the representation <span class="math inline">\(1 \mapsto \zeta_n\)</span>, a primitive root of unity.<br/>
</li><li> The complex irreducible representations of a product of finite groups <span class="math inline">\(G \times H\)</span> are given by the tensor products <span class="math inline">\(\rho \otimes \tau\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> are irreducible representations of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, respectively. Therefore, there is a natural isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\textup{Rep}_\CC(G) \otimes \textup{Rep}_\CC(H) \simeq \textup{Rep}_\CC(G \times H)\)</span>.
