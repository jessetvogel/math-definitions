<div class="example"><ul><li> Every field of characteristic zero is perfect. Namely, if an irreducible polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> were to have a multiple root (in some field extension), then <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will have a common factor. But this cannot happen as <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is irreducible and <span class="math inline">\(\deg(f') = \deg(f) - 1\)</span>.

</li><li> The field <span class="math inline">\(\FF_p(t)\)</span> is not perfect: the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f = x^p - t\)</span> is irreducible, but if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a root in some field extension, we have <span class="math inline">\(x^p - t = x^p - \alpha^p = (x - \alpha)^p\)</span>, which shows <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not separable.

</div><div class="example">A field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p > 0\)</span> is perfect if and only if the <a href="#AA:frobenius-morphism">Frobenius morphism</a> <span class="math inline">\(F : k \to k\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto x^p\)</span> is surjective. Namely, if <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is not surjective, there exists some <span class="math inline">\(a \in k \setminus \im F\)</span>. But then <span class="math inline">\(f = x^p - a\)</span> factors as <span class="math inline">\((x - \sqrt[p]{a})^p\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(k(\sqrt[p]{a})\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is inseparable, implying <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is not perfect. Conversely, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is surjective. For any irreducible and inseparable polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f \in k[x]\)</span>, we must have <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(f, f') \ne 1\)</span> and hence <span class="math inline">\(f' = 0\)</span>. Therefore, such <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a polynomial in <span class="math inline">\(x^p\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(f = a_n x^{p^n} + a_{n - 1} x^{p^{n - 1}} + \cdots + a_1 x^p + a_0\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(a_i \in k\)</span>. By surjectivity of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, we can write <span class="math inline">\(a_i = b_i^n\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(b_i \in k\)</span>. But then <span class="math inline">\(f = (b_n x^{p^{n - 1}} + b_{n - 1} x^{p^{n - 2}} + \cdots + b_1 x + b_0)^p\)</span>, contradicting the irreducibility of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.
