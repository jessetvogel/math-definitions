<div class="example">Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f(z) = z^2\)</span>, which can be written as <span class="math inline">\(f(x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v(x, y) = 2xy\)</span>. Then we see that
<span class="math display">\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \quad \textup{ and } \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -2y = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} , \]</span>
so <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is holomorphic.
