<div class="example">The ring of rational numbers <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span> is not finitely generated as a <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-algebra. Namely, for any <span class="math inline">\(q_1, \ldots, q_n \in \QQ\)</span>, the subring of <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span> generated as a <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-algebra by the <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span>, can only contain denominators with prime factors that are also prime factors of the denominators of the <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span>. But since there are infinitely many prime numbers, this subring cannot be the whole of <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>.
