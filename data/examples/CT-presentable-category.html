<div class="example">The category <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ab}\)</span> of <a href="#GT:abelian-group">abelian groups</a> is <i>large</i>: the objects (even up to isomorphism) form a proper class. However, it is determined by the smaller category of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ab}_\textup{fg}\)</span> of finitely generated abelian groups, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ab}\)</span> is the <a href="#CT:ind-completion">Ind-completion</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ab}_\textup{fg}\)</span>. This is another way of saying that <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Ab}\)</span> is locally presentable.
