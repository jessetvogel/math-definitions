<div class="example">The ring <span class="math inline">\(R = \ZZ[\sqrt{5}]\)</span> is not integrally closed as it does not contain the integral element <span class="math inline">\(\tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{5} + \tfrac{1}{2} \in \QQ(\sqrt{5})\)</span>, which satisfies <span class="math inline">\(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\)</span>.
