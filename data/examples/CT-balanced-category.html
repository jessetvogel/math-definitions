<div class="example"><ul><li> The category <b>Set</b> is balanced, as injective and surjective imply bijective.<br/>
</li><li> Any <a href="#HA:abelian-category">abelian category</a> is balanced. Since every monomorphism <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B\)</span> is the kernel of some map <span class="math inline">\(\pi : B \to C\)</span>, it is also the <a href="#CT:equalizer">equalizer</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. If moreover <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an epimorphism, then <span class="math inline">\(\pi = 0\)</span>, implying <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an isomorphism.<br/>
</li><li> The category <b>Ring</b> is not balanced. Namely, the inclusion <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ \to \QQ\)</span> is a monomorphism since it is injective, and an epimorphism since a morphism <span class="math inline">\(\QQ \to R\)</span> is determined by the image of <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>. However, it is clearly not an isomorphism.<br/>
</li><li> The category <b>Top</b> is not balanced. Namely, the map <span class="math inline">\(\RR \to \RR\)</span> from the <a href="#TO:discrete-topology">discrete topology</a> to the usual topology is a monomorphism and an epimorphism, but not an isomorphism.
