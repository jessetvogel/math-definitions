<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(G = \ZZ/2\ZZ\)</span> act on <span class="math inline">\(V = k^2\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\((x, y) \mapsto (x, -y)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is generated by a pseudoreflection, and indeed

a free polynomial algebra over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. However, if we let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> act on <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\((x, y) \mapsto (-x, -y)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is not generated by pseudoreflections, and indeed
<span class="math display">\[ k[x, y]^G = k[x^2, xy, y^2] = k[u, v, w] / (w^2 - uv) \]</span>
is not a free polynomial algebra over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.

Note that any <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cycle acts by a pseudo-reflection, and since <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> is generated by <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-cycles, we can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(k[V]^G\)</span> is a free polynomial algebra over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.
