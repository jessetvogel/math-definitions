<div class="example">Let <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> be <a href="#GT:group">groups</a> and let <span class="math inline">\(\varphi : H \to \textup{Aut}(N)\)</span> be a group homomorphism. Viewing <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> as a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_H\)</span> with a single object, this defines a functor <span class="math inline">\(F : \mathcal{C}_H \to \textbf{Cat}\)</span>, which sends the single object to <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_N\)</span> and sends <span class="math inline">\(h \in H\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(h)\)</span> seen as an endofunctor of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_N\)</span>. The category <span class="math inline">\(\int_{\mathcal{C}_H} F\)</span> has a single object, and morphisms are of the form <span class="math inline">\((h, n)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(h \in H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n \in N\)</span>. Composition of morphisms is given by
<span class="math display">\[ (h, n) \circ (h', n') = (h \circ h', n \circ \varphi(h)(n')) . \]</span>
That is, <span class="math inline">\(\int_{\mathcal{C}_H} F\)</span> is the <a href="#GT:semidirect-product">semidirect product</a> <span class="math inline">\(N \rtimes_\varphi H\)</span> seen as a category with a single object.
