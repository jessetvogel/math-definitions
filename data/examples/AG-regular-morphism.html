<div class="example">Every <a href="#AG:smooth-morphism">smooth morphism</a> is regular, but not conversely. Namely, for any field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, the morphism <span class="math inline">\(\Spec k \llbracket t \rrbracket \to \Spec k\)</span> is regular but not smooth, since <span class="math inline">\(k \llbracket t \rrbracket\)</span> is not finitely presented as <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-algebra.
