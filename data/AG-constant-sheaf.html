Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a topological space, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> an abelian group. The <b>constant sheaf</b> <span class="math inline">\(\underline{A}\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> determined by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the sheaf given by
<span class="math display">\[ \underline{A}(U) = \{ \textup{locally constant functions } U \to A \} , \]</span>
and the usual restriction maps. Note that for every connected open set <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\underline{A}(U) \simeq A\)</span>, hence the name &lsquo;constant sheaf&rsquo;.
