Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be a field of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p > 0\)</span>. The map <span class="math inline">\(F : k \to k : x \mapsto x^p\)</span> is a homomorphism (use binomial theorem) called the <b>Frobenius morphism</b>.<br/>
Note that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is injective as it is a field morphism. So when <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is finite, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> will also be surjective, and hence an automorphism of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.
