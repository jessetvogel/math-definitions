Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a commutative ring. An <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-module <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is <b>flat</b> if <span class="math inline">\((-) \otimes_R M\)</span> is exact. Since the tensor product is already right-exact, this is equivalent to saying <span class="math inline">\((-) \otimes_R M\)</span> sends injective morphisms to injective morphisms.
