Let <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> be a sentence in the language <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L} = \{ 0, 1, +, -, \cdot \}\)</span> for rings. The <b>Lefschetz principle</b> states that the following are equivalent:
<ol type="(i)"><li> <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is true in every algebraically closed field of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.
</li><li> <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is true in some algebraically closed field of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.
</li><li> <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is true in algebraically closed fields of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for arbitrary large primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
</li><li> <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is true in algebraically closed fields of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> for sufficiently large primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
</li></ol>
