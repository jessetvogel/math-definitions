A <b>graded ring</b> is a <a href="#CA:ring">ring</a> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that is decomposed as a direct sum
<span class="math display">\[ R = \bigoplus_{i \ge 0} R_i \]</span>
of additive groups, such that
<span class="math display">\[ R_i R_j \subset R_{i + j} \]</span>
for all <span class="math inline">\(i, j \ge 0\)</span>.
