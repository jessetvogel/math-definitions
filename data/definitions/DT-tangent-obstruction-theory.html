A <b>tangent-obstruction theory</b> for a <a href="#DT:deformation-functor">deformation functor</a> <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> consists of finite-dimensional <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-vector spaces <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> (called the <i>tangent space</i>) and <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span> (called the <i>obstruction space</i>) such that
<ul><li> for all small extensions <span class="math inline">\(0 \to M \to B \to A \to 0\)</span>, there exists an exact sequence of sets
<span class="math display">\[ T_1 \otimes_k M \to D(B) \to D(A) \xrightarrow{\textup{ob}} T_2 \otimes_k M , \]</span>
</li><li> when <span class="math inline">\(A = k\)</span> the sequence becomes
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to T_1 \otimes_k M \to D(B) \to D(k) \xrightarrow{\textup{ob}} T_2 \otimes_k M , \]</span>
</li><li> and these sequences are functorial in small extensions.
</li></ul><br/>
One obtains a <b>generalized tangent-obstruction theory</b> by removing the condition of finite-dimensionality.
