Let <span class="math inline">\(S = \bigoplus_{i \ge 0} S_i\)</span> be a <a href="#AA:graded-ring">graded ring</a>. The <b>Proj construction</b> assigns to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> the <a href="#AG:scheme">scheme</a> <span class="math inline">\(\Proj S = (X, \mathcal{O}_X)\)</span> defined as follows.
<ul><li> The topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of homogeneous <a href="#AA:prime-ideal">prime ideals</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p} \subset S\)</span> not containing the irrelevant ideal <span class="math inline">\(S_+ = \bigoplus_{i > 0} S_i\)</span>, whose closed sets are given precisely by the sets <span class="math inline">\(V(\mathfrak{a}) = \{ \textup{homogeneous prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} \subset S \textup{ with } \mathfrak{p} \supset \mathfrak{a} \}\)</span> for all homogeneous ideals <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{a} \subset S\)</span>.
</li><li> The sheaf of rings <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span> is given as follows. For each open set <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(U)\)</span> is the set of functions <span class="math inline">\(s : U \to \sqcup_{\mathfrak{p} \in U} {(S_\mathfrak{p})}_0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(s(\mathfrak{p}) \in (S_\mathfrak{p})_0\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p} \in U\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is locally a quotient of elements in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. This means that for each <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p} \in U\)</span>, there is a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V \subset U\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}\)</span>, and homogeneous elements <span class="math inline">\(a, f \in S\)</span> of the same degree such that for each <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{q} \in V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f \not\in \mathfrak{q}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s(\mathfrak{q}) = a / f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\((S_\mathfrak{q})_0\)</span>. The sets <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(U)\)</span> are indeed rings.
