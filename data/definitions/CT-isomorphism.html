A morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> in a <a href="#CT:category">category</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is an <b>isomorphism</b> if there exists a morphism <span class="math inline">\(g : Y \to X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(fg = \id_Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(gf = \id_X\)</span>. The morphism <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is called the <b>inverse</b> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and denoted <span class="math inline">\(g = f^{-1}\)</span>. If it exists, it is unique.<br/>
If an isomorphism between objects <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> exists, the objects are called <b>isomorphic</b>.
