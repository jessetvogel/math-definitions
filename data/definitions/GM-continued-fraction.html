Let <span class="math inline">\(x \in \RR\)</span> be a real number. The <b>continued fraction</b> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a (possibly finite) sequence
<span class="math display">\[ [a_0; a_1, a_2, \ldots] \]</span>
given by <span class="math inline">\(a_i = \lfloor x_i \rfloor\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{x_i - a_i}\)</span>. The sequence stops if <span class="math inline">\(x_i = a_i\)</span>, which happens precisely if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is rational.<br/>
The continued fraction of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is also commonly denoted as
<span class="math display">\[ x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + \cdots }}} . \]</span>
