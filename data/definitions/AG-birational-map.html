A <b>birational map</b> between (<a href="#TO:irreducible">irreducible</a>) <a href="#AG:variety">varieties</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a <a href="#AG:rational-map">rational map</a> <span class="math inline">\(f : X \dashrightarrow Y\)</span> which has a rational inverse. That is, there exists a rational map <span class="math inline">\(g : Y \dashrightarrow X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(gf = \id_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(fg = \id_Y\)</span> as rational maps.<br/>
If there is a birational map from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are called <b>birationally equivalent</b>, or simply <b>birational</b>.
