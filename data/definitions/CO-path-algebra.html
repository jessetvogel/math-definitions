Let <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> be a <a href="#CO:quiver">quiver</a>. A <b>path</b> in <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a sequence <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_n \alpha_{n - 1} \cdots \alpha_1\)</span> of arrows such that the head of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i + 1}\)</span> equals the tail of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_{i}\)</span>. The <b>path algebra</b> of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is defined as a <a href="#LA:vector-space">vector space</a> with the set of paths of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> as a basis. Multiplication is given by concatenation of paths, and if two paths cannot be connected because their endpoints are different, their product is defined as zero.
