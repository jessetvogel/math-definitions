The <b>de Rham isomorphism</b> is the isomorphism given by
<span class="math display">\[ H_{\textup{dR}}^k(X) \xrightarrow{\sim} H^k(X; \RR) : [ \omega ] \mapsto \int_{(-)} \omega . \]</span>
The exterior product endows the direct sum of these groups with a ring structure. A further result of the theorem is that the two cohomology rings are isomorphic (as <a href="#CA:graded-ring">graded rings</a>), where the analogous product on <a href="#AT:singular-homology">singular cohomology</a> is the <a href="#AT:cup-product">cup product</a>.
