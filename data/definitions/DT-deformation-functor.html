A <b>deformation functor</b> is a <a href="#CT:functor">functor</a>
<span class="math display">\[ D : \textbf{Art}_k \to \textbf{Set} \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Art}_k\)</span> is the category of local artinian <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-algebras with residue field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(D(k)\)</span> is a single point.<br/>
A morphism of deformation functors is a natural transformation of functors.
