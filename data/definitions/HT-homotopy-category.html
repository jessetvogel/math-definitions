Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> be a <a href="#HT:model-category">model category</a>. The <b>homotopy category</b> <span class="math inline">\(\textup{Ho}(\mathcal{C})\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is the <a href="#CT:category">category</a> whose
<ul><li> objects are the objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> which are both fibrant and cofibrant,
</li><li> morphisms are <a href="#HT:homotopy">homotopy classes</a> of maps.
</li></ul>
There is a functor <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C} \to \textup{Ho}(\mathcal{C})\)</span>, sending an object <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to its fibrant-cofibrant replacement.<br/>
Equivalently, the homotopy category is given as the <a href="#CT:localization">localization</a> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> by its class of weak equivalences.
