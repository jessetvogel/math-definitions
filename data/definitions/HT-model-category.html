A <b>model category</b> is a <a href="#CT:category">category</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> with three distinguished classes of maps: <i>weak equivalences</i>, <i>fibrations</i> and <i>cofibrations</i>, each of which is closed under composition and contains all identity maps. A map which is both a fibration (resp. cofibration) and a weak equivalence is called an <i>acyclic fibration</i> (resp. <i>acyclic cofibration</i>). The following axioms are required.
<ul><li> Finite limits and colimits exist in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.
</li><li> For maps <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(gf\)</span> is defined, if two out of the three maps <span class="math inline">\(f, g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(gf\)</span> are weak equivalences, then so is the third.
</li><li> If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a <a href="#CT:retract">retract</a> of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a fibration, cofibration or a weak equivalence, then so is <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.
</li><li> For any commutative diagram

such that either (i) <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is a cofibration and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> an acyclic fibration, or (ii) <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> an acyclic cofibration and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> a fibration, there exists a lift <span class="math inline">\(h : B \to X\)</span> making the diagram commute.
</li><li> Any map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can be factored in two ways: (i) <span class="math inline">\(f = pi\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> a cofibration and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> an acyclic fibration, and (ii) <span class="math inline">\(f = pi\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> an acyclic cofibration and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> a fibration.
</li></ul>
By the first axiom, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> has an <a href="#CT:initial-object">initial</a> object <span class="math inline">\(\varnothing\)</span> and a <a href="#CT:terminal-object">terminal</a> object <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span>. An object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is called <b>cofibrant</b> if <span class="math inline">\(\varnothing \to A\)</span> is a cofibration, and <b>fibrant</b> if <span class="math inline">\(A \to \star\)</span> is a fibration.
