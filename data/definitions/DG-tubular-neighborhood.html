Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a <a href="#DG:smooth-manifold">smooth manifold</a> and <span class="math inline">\(N \subset M\)</span> a smooth submanifold, and let <span class="math inline">\(T_{N/M}\)</span> be the <a href="#DG:normal-bundle">normal bundle</a> to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The <b>tubular neighborhood theorem</b> states that there exists an open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U \subset M\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, an open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V \subset T_{N/M}\)</span> of the zero section, and a <a href="#DG:diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a> <span class="math inline">\(\phi : U \to V\)</span> extending this zero section.<br/>
Such a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is called a <b>tubular neighborhood</b> of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.
