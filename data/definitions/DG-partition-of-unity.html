Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a <a href="#DG:smooth-manifold">smooth manifold</a>. A <b>partition of unity</b> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a set of smooth functions <span class="math inline">\(\{ f_\alpha : M \to [0, 1] \}\)</span> so that each point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> has a neighborhood where only finitely many <span class="math inline">\(f_\alpha\)</span> are nonzero and <span class="math inline">\(\sum_\alpha f_\alpha(p) = 1\)</span>.<br/>
It is a theorem that for any open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{ U_\alpha \}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, there exists a partition of unity <span class="math inline">\(\{ f_\alpha \}\)</span> such that the support of <span class="math inline">\(f_\alpha\)</span> is contained in <span class="math inline">\(U_\alpha\)</span>.
