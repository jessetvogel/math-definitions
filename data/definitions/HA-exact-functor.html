Let <span class="math inline">\(F : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}\)</span> be an <a href="#HA:additive-functor">additive functor</a> between <a href="#HA:abelian-category">abelian categories</a>. Then <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is called <b>left exact</b> if for all short exact sequences
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to M \to N \to L \to 0 \]</span>
in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>, the sequence
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to FM \to FN \to FL \]</span>
is exact. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is called <b>right exact</b> if for all such short exact sequences
<span class="math display">\[ FM \to FN \to FL \to 0 \]</span>
is exact. Finally, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is called <b>exact</b> if it is both left and right exact.
