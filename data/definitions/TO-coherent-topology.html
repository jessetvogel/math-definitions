Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> and <span class="math inline">\(C = \{ X_i : i \in I \}\)</span> a family of subsets <span class="math inline">\(X_i \subset X\)</span> with the <a href="#TO:subspace-topology">subspace topology</a>. Then <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>coherent with <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span></b> if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has the <a href="#TO:coarser">finest topology</a> such that the inclusions <span class="math inline">\(\iota_i : X_i \to X\)</span> are continuous.<br/>
There are two equivalent definitions:
<ul><li> A subset <span class="math inline">\(A \subset X\)</span> is closed if and only if <span class="math inline">\(A \cap X_i\)</span> is closed for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.
</li><li> A subset <span class="math inline">\(A \subset X\)</span> is open if and only if <span class="math inline">\(A \cap X_i\)</span> is open for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.
</li></ul>
