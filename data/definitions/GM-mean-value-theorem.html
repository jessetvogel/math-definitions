Let <span class="math inline">\(f : [a, b] \to \RR\)</span> be a continuous function, which is differentiable on <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>. The <b>mean value theorem</b> states that there exists a <span class="math inline">\(c \in (a, b)\)</span> such that
<span class="math display">\[ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} . \]</span>
