A <b>stack</b> (over a site <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{S}\)</span>) is a category fibered in groupoids over <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{S}\)</span> such that every descent datum is effective and isomorphisms are a sheaf. Morphisms of stacks are defined as morphisms of categories over <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{S}\)</span>, and similarly for 2-morphisms and isomorphisms.
