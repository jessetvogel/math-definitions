A <b>stack</b> (over a <a href="#CT:site">site</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{S}\)</span>) is a <a href="#CT:category-fibered-in-groupoids">category fibered in groupoids</a> over <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{S}\)</span> such that every <a href="#CT:descent-datum">descent datum</a> is effective and isomorphisms are a sheaf. Morphisms of stacks are defined as morphisms of categories over <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{S}\)</span>, and similarly for 2-morphisms and isomorphisms.
