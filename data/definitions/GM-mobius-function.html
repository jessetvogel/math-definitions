The <b>MÃ¶bius function</b> <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the function that assigns to any positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n > 0\)</span> the value
<span class="math display">\[ \mu(n) = \sum_{\substack{1 \le k \le n \\ \gcd(k, n) = 1}} e^{2\pi i \frac{k}{n}} , \]</span>
or alternatively,
<span class="math display">\[ \mu(n) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
         +1 & \textup{ if $n$ is square-free with even number of prime factors}, \\
         -1 & \textup{ if $n$ is square-free with odd number of prime factors}, \\
         0 & \textup{ if $n$ has a squared prime factor}.
    \end{array} \right. \]</span>
