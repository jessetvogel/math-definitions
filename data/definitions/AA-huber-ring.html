An <i>adic ring</i> is a topological <a href="#AA:ring">ring</a> <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for which there exists an <a href="#AA:ideal">ideal</a> <span class="math inline">\(I \subset A\)</span>, called the <i>ideal of definition</i>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\{ I^n : n \in \NN \}\)</span> is a <a href="#TO:neighborhood-basis">neighborhood basis</a> of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.<br/>
A <b>Huber ring</b> is a topological ring <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for which there exists an open adic subring <span class="math inline">\(A_0 \subset A\)</span> with finitely generated ideal of definition <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.
