Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> be a <a href="#CT:cartesian-closed-category">Cartesian closed category</a>. A morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> is called <i>point-surjective</i> if for every morphism <span class="math inline">\(p : 1 \to Y\)</span> there exists a morphism <span class="math inline">\(q : 1 \to X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p = f \circ q\)</span>. <b>Lawvereâ€™s fixed-point theorem</b> states that, if <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B^A\)</span> is a point-surjective morphism, then every morphism <span class="math inline">\(g : B \to B\)</span> has a <i>fixed point</i>, that is, a morphism <span class="math inline">\(p : 1 \to B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(g \circ p = p\)</span>.
