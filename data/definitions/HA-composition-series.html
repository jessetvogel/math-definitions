A <b>composition series</b> of an object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in an <a href="#HA:abelian-category">abelian category</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is a sequence of subobjects
<span class="math display">\[ 0 = A_0 \subsetneq A_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq A_n = A \]</span>
such that the quotients <span class="math inline">\(A_i/A_{i - 1}\)</span>, known as the <b>composition factors</b>, are simple for all <span class="math inline">\(1 \le i \le n\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has a composition series, the integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> only depends on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and is called the <i>length</i> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.
