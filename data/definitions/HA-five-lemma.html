Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> be an abelian category, and consider the following commutative diagram.
<img class="display-math-svg" src="data/svg/4eb00a3aef165cc68bbfd4ba6af4501a5de01220.svg" alt />
Suppose that both rows are exact. The <b>five lemma</b> states that
<ul><li> if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> are injective and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is surjective, then <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is injective.<br/>
</li><li> if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> are surjective and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is injective, then <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is surjective.<br/>
</li><li> if <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> are isomorphisms, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is surjective and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is injective, then <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is an isomorphism.
</li></ul>
