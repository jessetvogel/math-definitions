For any <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> a field with <span class="math inline">\(n! \nmid \operatorname{char}(k)\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(\rho : S_n \to \textup{GL}_n(k)\)</span> be the <a href="#RT:representation">representation</a> of the <a href="#GT:symmetric-group">symmetric group</a> <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> which permutes the basis vectors. The <b>standard representation</b> of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> is the quotient of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> by the one-dimensional subrepresentation spanned by the sum of the basis vectors. Alternatively, the standard representation of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> is the subrepresentation of <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> corresponding to the subspace of <span class="math inline">\(k^n\)</span> where the sum of coordinates is zero.<br/>
The standard representation is <a href="#RT:irreducible-representation">irreducible</a>.
