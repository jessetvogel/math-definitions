A <b>mixed Hodge structure</b> is a triple <span class="math inline">\(H = (H_\ZZ, W_\bdot, F^\bdot)\)</span> consisting of a <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-module <span class="math inline">\(H_\ZZ\)</span>, an increasing filtration <span class="math inline">\(W_\bdot\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(H_\QQ = H_\ZZ \otimes \QQ\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \subset \cdots \subset W_k \subset W_{k + 1} \cdots \subset H_\QQ \]</span>
and a decreasing filtration <span class="math inline">\(F^\bdot\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(H_\CC = H_\ZZ \otimes \CC\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[ H_\CC \supset \cdots \supset F^p \supset F^{p + 1} \supset \cdots \supset 0 \]</span>
such that the induced filtrations (obtained by intersections) of <span class="math inline">\(F^\bdot\)</span> on the graded pieces <span class="math inline">\(\left(\textup{Gr}^W_k H_\QQ\right) \otimes_\QQ \CC := \left(W_k H_\QQ / W_{k - 1} H_\QQ\right) \otimes_\QQ \CC\)</span> are <a href="#LA:hodge-structure">rational Hodge structures</a> of weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.<br/>
A <b>morphism of mixed Hodge structures</b> is a morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : H_\ZZ \to H'_\ZZ\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-modules compatible with the two filtrations <span class="math inline">\(W_\bdot\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^\bdot\)</span>.<br/>
The numbers <span class="math inline">\(h^{p, q}(H) := \dim_\CC \textup{Gr}_F^p \textup{Gr}^W_{p + q}(H_\CC)\)</span> are called the <b>mixed Hodge numbers</b> of the mixed Hodge structure <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.
