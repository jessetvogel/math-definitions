Let <span class="math inline">\(S = \bigoplus_{i \ge 0} S_i\)</span> be a finitely generated graded commutative algebra over a field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(S_0 = k\)</span>. The Hilbert function
<span class="math display">\[ i \mapsto \dim_k S_i \]</span>
becomes polynomial for large enough values of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and the resulting polynomial is called the <b>Hilbert polynomial</b> <span class="math inline">\(\text{HP}_S(i)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.
