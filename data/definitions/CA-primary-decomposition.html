Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a commutative <a href="#CA:ring">ring</a>. A <b>primary decomposition</b> of an ideal <span class="math inline">\(I \subset R\)</span> is an expression of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> as a finite intersection of <a href="#CA:primary-ideal">primary ideals</a>,
<span class="math display">\[ I = \bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} \mathfrak{q}_i . \]</span><br/>
The primary decomposition is said to be <b>minimal</b> if (i) the <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}_i = r(\mathfrak{q}_i)\)</span> are all distinct, and (ii) no <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{q}_i\)</span> contains the intersection of the other primary ideals.
