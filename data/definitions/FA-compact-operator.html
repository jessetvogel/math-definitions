An operator <span class="math inline">\(T : X \to Y\)</span> between <a href="#FA:norm">normed</a> <a href="#LA:vector-space">vector spaces</a> is <b>compact</b> if for every bounded subset <span class="math inline">\(V \subset X\)</span>, the image <span class="math inline">\(T(V)\)</span> is relatively compact, i.e. the closure <span class="math inline">\(\overline{T(V)} \subset Y\)</span> is compact.
