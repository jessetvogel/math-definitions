An <b>abelian category</b> is an <a href="#HA:additive-category">additive category</a> category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> in which
<ul><li> every morphism <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a kernel (that is, an <a href="#CT:equalizer">equalizer</a> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) and a cokernel (that is, a <a href="#CT:coequalizer">coequalizer</a> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>),
</li><li> every <a href="#CT:monomorphism">monomorphism</a> is the kernel of some morphism, and every <a href="#CT:epimorphism">epimorphism</a> is the cokernel of some morphism.
</li></ul>
