Let <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> be a set. The <b>symmetric group</b> on <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is the <a href="#GT:group">group</a> <span class="math inline">\(S_\Sigma\)</span> of all bijections <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma \to \Sigma\)</span>, where multiplication is given by composition, and the unit is given by the identity map <span class="math inline">\(\id_\Sigma\)</span>.<br/>
Given an integer <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 1\)</span>, one writes <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> for the symmetric group on the set <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}\)</span>. Elements of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> are called <b>permutations</b>.
