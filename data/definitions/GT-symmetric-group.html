Let <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> be a set. The <b>symmetric group</b> on <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is the <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('GT:group');">group</a> <span class="math inline">\(S_\Sigma\)</span> of all bijections <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma \to \Sigma\)</span>. The group law is given by composition, and the unit is the identity map.<br/>
When <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}\)</span> for some integer <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 1\)</span>, one writes <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> for the symmetry group. Its elements are called <b>permutations</b>.
