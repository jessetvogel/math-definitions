A <b>diagonalization</b> of an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> consists of an invertible matrix <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and a diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> such that
<span class="math display">\[ D = C A C^{-1} . \]</span>
If such a diagonalization exists, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is said to be <b>diagonalizable</b>.
