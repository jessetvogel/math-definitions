Let <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be an <a href="#AA:algebraically-closed-field">algebraically closed field</a> and <span class="math inline">\(A = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 0\)</span>. For any subset <span class="math inline">\(S \subset A\)</span>, let
<span class="math display">\[ Z(S) = \{ p \in \AA^n \mid f(p) = 0 \textup{ for all } f \in S \} , \]</span>
which is a closed subset of <span class="math inline">\(\AA^n_k = \Spec A\)</span>. Conversely, for any subset <span class="math inline">\(Y \subset \AA^n_k\)</span>, let
<span class="math display">\[ I(Y) = \{ f \in A \mid f(p) = 0 \textup{ for all } p \in Y \} , \]</span>
which is a <a href="#AA:radical-ideal">radical ideal</a> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.
<b>Hilbertâ€™s Nullstellensatz</b> states that <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, when restricted to the set of radical ideals of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the set of closed subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\AA^n_k\)</span>, are inverses of each other. Moreover, they reverse the partial orderings on these sets given by inclusion: <span class="math inline">\(I \subset J\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(Z(I) \supset Z(J)\)</span> for all radical ideals <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.
