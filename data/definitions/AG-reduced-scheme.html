A <a href="#AG:scheme">scheme</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>reduced</b> if for every open subset <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span> the ring <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(U)\)</span> is <a href="#AA:reduced-ring">reduced</a>.<br/>
Equivalently, this is the case if all stalks <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_{X, x}\)</span> are reduced.
