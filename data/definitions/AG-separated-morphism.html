A morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> of <a href="#AG:scheme">schemes</a> is <b>quasi-separated</b> if the diagonal <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{X/Y} : X \to X \times_Y X\)</span> is quasi-compact, and it is <b>separated</b> if the diagonal <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_{X/Y}\)</span> is a closed immersion.
