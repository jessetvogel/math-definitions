A <b>pure Hodge structure of weight <span class="math inline">\(k \in \ZZ\)</span></b> consists of a <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-module <span class="math inline">\(H_\ZZ\)</span> of finite rank, and a direct sum decomposition of the complexification
<span class="math display">\[ H_\CC := H_\ZZ \otimes_\ZZ \CC = \bigoplus_{p + q = k} H^{p, q} \quad \text{ with } \quad H^{p, q} = \overline{H^{q, p}} . \]</span>
One speaks of <i>rational</i> or <i>real</i> Hodge structures when replacing <span class="math inline">\(V_\ZZ\)</span> by a rational of real vector space.<br/>
A <b>morphism of Hodge structures</b> is a morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : H_\ZZ \to H'_\ZZ\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-modules such that its complexification <span class="math inline">\(f_\CC\)</span> preserves type, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(f_\CC\left(H^{p, q}\right) \subset (H')^{p, q}\)</span>.<br/>
The numbers <span class="math inline">\(h^{p, q}(H) := \dim_\CC H^{p, q}\)</span> are called the <b>Hodge numbers</b> of the Hodge structure.
