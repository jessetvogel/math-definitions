A <a href="#HT:model-category">model category</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is called <b>right proper</b> if weak equivalences are preserved by pullback along fibrations. That is, for every weak equivalence <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> and fibration <span class="math inline">\(g : Z \to Y\)</span>, the pullback <span class="math inline">\(g^* f : X \times_Y Z \to Z\)</span> is a weak equivalence.<br/>
Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is <b>left proper</b> if weak equivalences are preserved by pushout along cofibrations.
Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is <b>proper</b> if it is both left and right proper.
