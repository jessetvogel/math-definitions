An <b>fpqc covering</b> of a <a href="#AG:scheme">scheme</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a family of morphisms <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ f_i : X_i \to X \right\}_{i \in I}\)</span> that are all <a href="#AG:flat-morphism">flat</a>, and such that for every affine open <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span> there exists a finite subset <span class="math inline">\(J \subset I\)</span> and affine opens <span class="math inline">\(V_j \subset X_j\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(j \in J\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(U = \bigcup_{j \in J} f_j(V_j)\)</span>. That is, every affine open in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be covered by finitely many affine opens from the <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>.<br/>
&rsquo;fpqc&rsquo; stands for <i>fid√®lement plat et quasi-compact</i>.
