An <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is said to be in <b>row echelon form</b> if
<ul><li> the zero rows of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are below the nonzero rows of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and
</li><li> the <i>pivot</i> of each nonzero row, i.e. its first nonzero entry, is farther to the right than the pivots of the rows above.
</li></ul>
The matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is said to be in <b>reduced row echelon form</b> if in addition
<ul><li> the pivot of each nonzero row is equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>,
</li><li> the pivot of each nonzero row is the only nonzero entry in its column.
</li></ul>
