The <b>simplex category</b>, often denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, is the <a href="#CT:category">category</a> whose objects are sets of the form
<span class="math display">\[ [n] = \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n \}, \qquad \text{ with } n \ge 0 , \]</span>
and whose morphisms are order-preserving functions between these sets.
