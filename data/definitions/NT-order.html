A <a href="#NT:number-field">number ring</a> whose additive group is finitely generated is called an <b>order</b> in its <a href="#AA:field-of-fractions">field of fractions</a>.<br/>
As number rings do not have additive torsion elements, every order is free of finite rank over <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>. The rank of an order <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(K = Q(R)\)</span> is bounded by <span class="math inline">\(n = [ K : \QQ ]\)</span>, and as <span class="math inline">\(R \otimes_\ZZ \QQ = K\)</span> it has to equal <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus,
<span class="math display">\[ R = \ZZ \cdot \omega_1 \oplus \ZZ \cdot \omega_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus \ZZ \cdot \omega_n \]</span>
for some <span class="math inline">\(\QQ\)</span>-basis <span class="math inline">\(\{ \omega_1, \ldots, \omega_n \}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.
