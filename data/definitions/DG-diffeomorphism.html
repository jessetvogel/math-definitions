A <b>diffeomorphism</b> is a <a href="#DG:smooth-map">smooth map</a> <span class="math inline">\(f : M \to N\)</span> between <a href="#DG:smooth-manifold">smooth manifolds</a> that has a smooth inverse <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1} : N \to M\)</span>.<br/>
A <b>local diffeomorphism</b> is a smooth map <span class="math inline">\(f : M \to N\)</span> for which every point <span class="math inline">\(p \in M\)</span> has a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U \subset M\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(U)\)</span> is open in <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f : U \to f(U)\)</span> is a diffeomorphism.<br/>
The manifolds <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> are called <b>diffeomorphic</b> if there exists diffeomorphism between them.
