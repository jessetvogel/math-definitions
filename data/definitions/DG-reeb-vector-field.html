Let <span class="math inline">\((M, \xi)\)</span> be a <a href="#DG:contact-structure">contact manifold</a>. The <b>Reeb vector field</b> corresponding to a contact form <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the <a href="#DG:vector-field">vector field</a> <span class="math inline">\(R_\alpha\)</span> defined by
<span class="math display">\[ \iota_{R_\alpha} d \alpha = 0 \quad \textup{ and } \quad \iota_{R_\alpha} \alpha = 1 . \]</span>
The flow generated by <span class="math inline">\(R_\alpha\)</span> is called the <b>Reeb flow</b>.
