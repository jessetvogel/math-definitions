A <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>paracompact</b> if every open cover of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has an open <a href="#TO:cover-refinement">refinement</a> that is locally finite. An open cover is <i>locally finite</i> if any point has an open neighborhood where only finitely many sets of the open cover intersect.
