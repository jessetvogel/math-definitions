The <b>Alexander–Conway polynomial</b> of a <a href="#DG:knot">knot</a> <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_K(z) \in \ZZ[z^{\pm 1}]\)</span>, uniquely determined by the properties
<ul><li> equivalent knots have the same Alexander–Conway polynomial,
</li><li> the Alexander–Conway polynomial of the unknot is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>,
</li><li> for every crossing of the knot, replacing this crossing by other possible crossings yields different knots whose Alexander–Conway polynomials are related according to
