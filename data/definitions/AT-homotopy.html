A <b>homotopy</b> between <a href="#TO:continuous-map">continuous maps</a> <span class="math inline">\(f, g : X \to Y\)</span> is a continuous map
<span class="math display">\[ H : X \times [0, 1] \to Y \]</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(H(x, 0) = f(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H(x, 1) = g(x)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span>. If such a homotopy exists, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are called <b>homotopic</b>.
