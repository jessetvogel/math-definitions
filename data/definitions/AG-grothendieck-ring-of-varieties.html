Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a <a href="#AG:variety">variety</a> over a field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. The <b>Grothendieck ring of varieties</b> over <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\textup{K}(\textbf{Var}/S)\)</span>, is defined as the quotient of the <a href="#GT:free-group">free abelian group</a> on the isomorphism classes of varieties over <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, by relations of the form
<span class="math display">\[ [X] = [Z] + [U] , \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Z \subset X\)</span> is a closed subvariety and <span class="math inline">\(U = X \backslash Z\)</span> its open complement. Multiplication is defined by
<span class="math display">\[ [X] \cdot [Y] = [(X \times_S Y)_\textup{red}] \]</span>
and extended linearly.
