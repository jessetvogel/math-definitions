Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a <a href="#AA:ring">commutative ring</a>. The <b>spectrum</b> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the <a href="#AG:ringed-space">locally ringed space</a> <span class="math inline">\((X, \mathcal{O}_X)\)</span> defined as follows.
<ul><li> The topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of <a href="#AA:prime-ideal">prime ideals</a> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, whose closed sets are given precisely by the sets <span class="math inline">\(V(I) = \{ \textup{prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} \textup{ with } \mathfrak{p} \supset I \}\)</span> for all ideals <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.
</li><li> The <a href="#AG:sheaf">sheaf</a> of rings <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span> is given as follows. For each open set <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(U)\)</span> is the set of functions <span class="math inline">\(s : U \to \sqcup_{\mathfrak{p} \in U} R_\mathfrak{p}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(s(\mathfrak{p}) \in R_\mathfrak{p}\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p} \in U\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is locally a quotient of elements of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. This means that for each <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p} \in U\)</span>, there is a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(V \subset U\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{p}\)</span>, and elements <span class="math inline">\(a, f \in R\)</span> such that for each <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{q} \in V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f \not\in \mathfrak{q}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s(\mathfrak{q}) = a/f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A_\mathfrak{q}\)</span>. The sets <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X(U)\)</span> are indeed rings.
</li></ul>
The spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\Spec R\)</span>.
