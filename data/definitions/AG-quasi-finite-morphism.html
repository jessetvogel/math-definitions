A morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> of <a href="#AG:scheme">schemes</a> is <b>quasi-finite</b> if it is of <a href="#AG:finite-type">finite type</a>, and every point <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> is isolated in its fiber <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(f(x))\)</span>, i.e. every fiber is a discrete finite set.
