Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> an abelian group. The <b>reduced homology</b> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with coefficients in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is defined by
<span class="math display">\[ \tilde{H}_n(X; A) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \ker(H_0(X; A) \to H_0(\star; A)) & \text{ if } n = 0 , \\ H_n(X; A) & \text{ if } n > 0 , \end{array} \right. \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(H_0(X; A) \to H_0(\star; A)\)</span> is the map induced by the map <span class="math inline">\(X \to \star\)</span> to the one-point space.
