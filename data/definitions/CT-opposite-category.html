The <b>opposite category</b> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^\textup{op}\)</span> of a <a href="#CT:category">category</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is formed by reversing the morphisms. That is, the objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^\textup{op}\)</span> are the objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and there is a morphism <span class="math inline">\(f^\textup{op} : Y \to X\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^\textup{op}\)</span> for each morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.
