A <b>noetherian formal scheme</b> is a <a href="#AG:ringed-space">locally ringed space</a> <span class="math inline">\((\mathfrak{X}, \mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{X})\)</span>, which has a finite open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{ \mathfrak{U}_i \}\)</span> such that for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the pair <span class="math inline">\((\mathfrak{U}_i, \mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{X}|_{\mathfrak{U}_i})\)</span> is isomorphic to the <a href="#AG:formal-completion">formal completion</a> of some noetherian scheme <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> along a closed subscheme <span class="math inline">\(Y \subset X\)</span>.
