An <b>abelian variety</b> is a <a href="#AG:complete-variety">complete</a> <a href="#AG:variety">variety</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> over a field <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> which is also an <a href="#AG:algebraic-group">algebraic group</a>. That is, it comes with a group structure such that the multiplication map <span class="math inline">\(X \times X \to X\)</span> and the inversion map <span class="math inline">\(X \to X\)</span> are morphisms of varieties.
