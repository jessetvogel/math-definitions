A <b>perfect complex</b> of modules over a commutative ring <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is an object in the <a href="#HA:derived-category">derived category</a> of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-modules that is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finite projective <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-modules. A <b>perfect module</b> is a module which is perfect when seen as a complex concentrated at degree zero.
