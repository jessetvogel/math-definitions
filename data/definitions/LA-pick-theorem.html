Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a simple polygon in the plane whose vertices have integer coordinates. Let <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> be the number of lattice points in the interior of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the number of lattice points on the boundary of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Then <b>Pickâ€™s theorem</b> states that the area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[ A = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1 . \]</span>
