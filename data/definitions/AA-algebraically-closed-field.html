A <a href="#AA:field">field</a> <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is <b>algebraically closed</b> if every polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f \in k[x]\)</span> has a root in <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.<br/>
In particular, in this case every such polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will split completely into linear factors over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.
