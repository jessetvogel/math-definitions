Given a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the <b>free group</b> on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(F_S\)</span>, is the <a href="#GT:group">group</a> consisting of all words that can be built from elements of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{ s^{-1} : s \in S \}\)</span>, where two words are different unless their equality follows from the group axioms. Composition is given by concatenation of words, and the unit element is the empty word. The members of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are called <i>generators</i> of <span class="math inline">\(F_S\)</span>, and the number of generators (i.e. the size of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) is the <i>rank</i> of <span class="math inline">\(F_S\)</span>.<br/>
The <b>free abelian group</b> on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the <a href="#GT:abelian-group">abelian</a> group <span class="math inline">\(\bigoplus_{s \in S} \ZZ\)</span>.
