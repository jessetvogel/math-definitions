A <b>mixed Hodge structure</b> on a <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-module <span class="math inline">\(H_\ZZ\)</span> consists of an increasing <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-filtration <span class="math inline">\(W_\bdot\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(H_\QQ = H_\ZZ \otimes \QQ\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \subset \cdots \subset W_i \subset W_{i + 1} \cdots \subset H_\QQ \]</span>
and a decreasing <span class="math inline">\(\NN\)</span>-filtration <span class="math inline">\(F^\bullet\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(H_\CC = H_\ZZ \otimes \CC\)</span>,
<span class="math display">\[ H_\CC = F^0 \supset F^1 \supset \cdots \supset 0 \]</span>
such that the induced filtrations (obtained by intersections) of <span class="math inline">\(F^\bdot\)</span> on the graded pieces <span class="math inline">\(\text{Gr}^W_k H_\QQ := W_k H_\QQ / W_{k - 1} H_\QQ\)</span> are <a href="#UN:pure-hodge-structure">pure (rational) Hodge structures</a> of weight <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.<br/>
A <b>morphism of mixed Hodge structures</b> is a morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : H_\ZZ \to H'_\ZZ\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\ZZ\)</span>-modules compatible with the two filtrations <span class="math inline">\(W_\bdot\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F^\bdot\)</span>.<br/>
The numbers <span class="math inline">\(h^{p, q}(H) := \dim_\CC \textup{Gr}_F^p \textup{Gr}^W_{p + q}(H_\CC)\)</span> are called the <b>mixed Hodge numbers</b> of the mixed Hodge structure <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>.
