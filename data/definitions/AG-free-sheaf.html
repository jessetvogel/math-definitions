Let <span class="math inline">\((X, \mathcal{O}_X)\)</span> be a <a href="#AG:ringed-space">ringed space</a>. An <a href="#AG:O-module"><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span>-module</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is <b>free</b> if it is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span>.<br/>
It is <b>locally free</b> if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be covered by open sets <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}|_U\)</span> is free. In that case, the <i>rank</i> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> on such an open set is the number of copies of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is connected, this rank is the same everywhere.
