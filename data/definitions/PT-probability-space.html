A <b>probability space</b> is a <a href="#MT:measure-space">measure space</a> <span class="math inline">\((\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \PP)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\PP\)</span> is a <i>probability measure</i>, that is, a measure such that <span class="math inline">\(\PP(\Omega) = 1\)</span>. Measurable sets <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{A}\)</span> are called <i>events</i>, and the value <span class="math inline">\(\PP(A)\)</span> is called the <i>probability</i> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.
