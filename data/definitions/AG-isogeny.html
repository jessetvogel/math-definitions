Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> be <a href="#AG:algebraic-group">algebraic groups</a>. An <b>isogeny</b> from <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a surjective morphism of algebraic groups <span class="math inline">\(f : G \to H\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\ker f\)</span> is finite.
