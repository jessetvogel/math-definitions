A <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>simply connected</b> if it is <a href="#TO:path-connected-space">path-connected</a> and every loop <span class="math inline">\(f : S^1 \to X\)</span> can be contracted to a point, i.e. there exists map <span class="math inline">\(F : D^2 \to X\)</span> which restricts to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>.<br/>
A topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>locally simply connected</b> if it admits a <a href="#TO:basis">basis</a> of simply connected sets.
