Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a non-singular <a href="#AG:variety">variety</a> over <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> a non-singular closed irreducible subvariety defined by the sheaf of ideals <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{I}\)</span>. The <b>conormal sheaf</b> of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the sheaf
<span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2 . \]</span>
Its dual
<span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{N}_{Y/X} = \mathcal{H}\textup{om}(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2, \mathcal{O}_X) \]</span>
is called the <b>normal sheaf</b> of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. It is locally free of rank <span class="math inline">\(r = \textup{codim}(Y)\)</span>.
