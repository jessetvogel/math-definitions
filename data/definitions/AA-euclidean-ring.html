A <b>Euclidean ring</b> is a <a href="#AA:domain">domain</a> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> for which there exists a function
<span class="math display">\[ g : R^\times \to \ZZ_{\ge 0} \]</span>
such that for all <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in R\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(b \ne 0\)</span>, there exists <span class="math inline">\(q, r \in R\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a = qb + r\)</span> and either <span class="math inline">\(r = 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(g(r) < g(b)\)</span>.<br/>
That is, a ring in which one can perform division with remainder. The function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is used to say that the ‘remainder’ <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is ‘smaller’ than the element <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> one divides by.<br/>
In particular, one can find the <i>gcd</i> of elements by means of the <i>Euclidean algorithm</i>.
