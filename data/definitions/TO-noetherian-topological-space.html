A <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>noetherian</b> if it satisfies the <i>descending chain condition</i> for closed subsets. That is, for any sequence <span class="math inline">\(Y_1 \supset Y_2 \supset \cdots\)</span> of closed subsets <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, there is an integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(Y_n = Y_{n + 1} = \cdots\)</span>.
