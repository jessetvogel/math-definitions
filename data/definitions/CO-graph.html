A <b>graph</b> consists of a set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> together with a set <span class="math inline">\(E \subset \{ \{ x, y \} : x, y \in V \textup{ and } x \ne y \}\)</span>.<br/>
A <b>directed graph</b> consists of a set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> together with a set <span class="math inline">\(E \subset \{ (x, y) : x, y \in V \textup{ and } x \ne y \}\)</span>.<br/>
The elements of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> are called <i>vertices</i> and the elements of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> are called <i>edges</i>.
