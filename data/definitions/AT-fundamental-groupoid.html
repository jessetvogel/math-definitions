Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> and <span class="math inline">\(A \subset X\)</span> a subset. The <b>fundamental groupoid of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span></b>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(X, A)\)</span>, is the <a href="#CT:groupoid">groupoid category</a> whose objects are elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and whose morphisms <span class="math inline">\(a \to b\)</span> are homotopy classes of paths from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Composition of morphisms is given by concatenation of paths.<br/>
This construction only depends on the homotopy type of <span class="math inline">\((X, A)\)</span>. In particular, if <span class="math inline">\(A = \{ x_0 \}\)</span> is a single point, the fundamental groupoid <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(X, A)\)</span> equals the <a href="#AT:fundamental-group">fundamental group</a> <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(X, x_0)\)</span>.
