Given a partition <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_k)\)</span> of a non-negative integer <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 0\)</span>, a <b>Young diagram</b> of shape <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a collection of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> boxes, arranged in left-aligned rows, such that row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i\)</span> boxes. For example, a Young diagram of shape <span class="math inline">\((5, 3, 2)\)</span> is given by:
<img class="display-math-svg" src="data/svg/32b4927381770d54238064eed4a04ee7d7861d6f.svg" alt />
The <i>arm length</i> of a box <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(a_\lambda(s)\)</span>, is the number of boxes to the right of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The <i>leg length</i> of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(l_\lambda(s)\)</span>, is the number of boxes below <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.<br/>
A <b>Young tableau</b> is obtained from a Young diagram by filling in the boxes with numbers. A Young tableau is <b>standard</b> if the entries in each row and each column are increasing.
