If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is an algebraic group acting on a scheme <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the <b>quotient stack</b> <span class="math inline">\([S/G]\)</span> is defined as the category over <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Sch}\)</span> whose objects over <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are principal <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-bundles <span class="math inline">\(P \to T\)</span>, with a <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-equivariant morphism <span class="math inline">\(P \to S\)</span>. Its morphisms are <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-equivariant isomorphisms which are compatible with the morphisms to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.
