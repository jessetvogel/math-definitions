The <b>Jones polynomial</b> of a <a href="#DG:knot">knot</a> <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a polynomial <span class="math inline">\(J(K) \in \ZZ[q^{\pm 1/2}]\)</span>, uniquely determined by the properties
<ul><li> equivalent knots have the same Jones polynomial,
</li><li> the Jones polynomial of the unknot is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>,
</li><li> for every crossing of the knot, replacing this crossing by other possible crossings yields different knots whose Jones polynomials are related according to
