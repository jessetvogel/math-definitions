Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a topological space, <span class="math inline">\(X' \subset X\)</span> a subspace, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> an abelian group. The <b>relative chain complex</b> of <span class="math inline">\((X, X')\)</span> is defined as the quotient complex
<span class="math display">\[ C_n(X, X'; A) = C_n(X; A) / C_n(X'; A) .  \]</span>
Its <a href="#AT:homology-group">homology groups</a>
<span class="math display">\[ H_n(X, X'; A) = H_n(C_\bullet(X, X; A)) \]</span>
are called <b>relative homology groups</b> of <span class="math inline">\((X, X')\)</span>.<br/>
From the exact sequence
<span class="math display">\[ 0 \to C_\bdot(X'; A) \to C_\bdot(X; A) \to C_\bdot(X, X'; A) \to 0 \]</span>
follows the long exact sequence in homology
<span class="math display">\[ \cdots \to H_n(X; A) \to H_n(X, X'; A) \xrightarrow{\delta} H_{n - 1}(X'; A) \to \cdots \to H_0(X, X'; A) \to 0 . \]</span>
