Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be <a href="#FA:banach-space">Banach spaces</a> and <span class="math inline">\(T : X \to Y\)</span> a surjective continuous linear operator. The <b>open mapping theorem</b> states that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is an open map. That is, for all open <span class="math inline">\(U \subset X\)</span>, the image  <span class="math inline">\(T(U) \subset Y\)</span> is open as well.
