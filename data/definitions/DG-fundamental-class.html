The <b>fundamental class</b> of a closed orientable <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a homology class <span class="math inline">\([M] \in H_n(M; \ZZ)\)</span> which is a generator of the homology group corresponding to the orientation of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.
