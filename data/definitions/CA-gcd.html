Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a commutative <a href="#CA:ring">ring</a>. A <b>greatest common divisor</b> of two elements <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in R\)</span> is an element <span class="math inline">\(d \in R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(d | a, b\)</span> and for any other <span class="math inline">\(d' \in R\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(d' | a, b\)</span> one has <span class="math inline">\(d' | d\)</span>. It is denoted <span class="math inline">\(d = \text{gcd}(a, b)\)</span>.
