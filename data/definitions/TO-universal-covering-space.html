A <b>universal covering space</b> of a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a <a href="#TO:covering-space">covering space</a> <span class="math inline">\(\pi : \tilde{X} \to X\)</span> which is <a href="#TO:simply-connected-space">simply connected</a>. It has the universal property that for any other connected covering <span class="math inline">\(p : Y \to X\)</span> there exists a unique covering map <span class="math inline">\(f : \tilde{X} \to Y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi = p \circ f\)</span>.

A universal cover can explicitly be constructed as follows. Let <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> be a basepoint, and let <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}_x\)</span> be the set of homotopy classes of paths <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : [0, 1] \to X\)</span> starting at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\pi : \tilde{X}_x \to X\)</span> given by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \mapsto \gamma(1)\)</span>. There is a suitable topology on <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}_x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi : \tilde{X}_x \to X\)</span> is continuous and a universal covering space of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.
