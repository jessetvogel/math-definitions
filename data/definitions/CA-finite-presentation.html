A <a href="#CA:ring-morphism">ring morphism</a> <span class="math inline">\(R \to S\)</span> is said to be of <b>finite presentation</b> if <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(R[x_1, \ldots, x_n] / (f_1, \ldots, f_m)\)</span> for some integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and some <span class="math inline">\(f_i \in R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\)</span>.<br/>
In this case, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is also said to be a <b>finitely presented <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-algebra</b>.
