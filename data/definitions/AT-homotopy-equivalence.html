A <b>homotopy equivalence</b> between two <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological spaces</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a pair of <a href="#TO:continuous-map">continuous maps</a> <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g : Y \to X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f\)</span> is <a href="#AT:homotopy">homotopic</a> to <span class="math inline">\(\id_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f \circ g\)</span> is homotopic to <span class="math inline">\(\id_Y\)</span>. If such a pair exists, then <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are said to be <b>homotopy equivalent</b>.
