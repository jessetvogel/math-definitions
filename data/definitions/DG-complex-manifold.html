Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a <a href="#DG:smooth-manifold">smooth manifold</a>. An <b>almost complex structure</b> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a smooth <a href="#DG:tensor-field">tensor field</a> <span class="math inline">\(J \in \Gamma(TM \otimes T*M)\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(J^2 = -1\)</span> when viewed as a bundle isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(J : TM \to TM\)</span>. The pair <span class="math inline">\((M, J)\)</span> is called an <b>almost complex manifold</b>.<br/>
A smooth manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is <b>complex</b> if it has an <a href="#DG:atlas">atlas</a> of charts to open subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\CC^n\)</span>, such that the transition maps are <i>holomorphic</i>. Any complex smooth manifold has an almost complex structure given by multiplication by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. If an almost complex structure arises in this way, it is called a <b>complex structure</b> or <i>integrable</i>.
