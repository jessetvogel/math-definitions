Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional <a href="#DG:smooth-manifold">smooth manifold</a>. A <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-dimensional <b>foliation</b> of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a decomposition of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> into a union of disjoint connected submanifolds
<span class="math display">\[ M = \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} L_\alpha \]</span>
such that each point <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span> has a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> with local coordinates <span class="math inline">\(x^1, \ldots, x^n\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x^{p + 1}, \ldots, x^n\)</span> are constant on <span class="math inline">\(U \cap L_\alpha\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in A\)</span>. The submanifolds <span class="math inline">\(L_\alpha\)</span> are called the <b>leaves</b> of the foliation, and the foliation is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F} = \{ L_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in A}\)</span>.
