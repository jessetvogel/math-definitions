<b>Lieâ€™s theorems</b> are three theorems about the relation between <a href="#DG:lie-group">Lie groups</a> and finite-dimensional <a href="#AA:lie-algebra">Lie algebras</a>.
<ol type="(I)"><li> If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are locally isomorphic Lie groups, then their Lie algebras <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span> are isomorphic.
</li><li> If <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> are Lie groups with Lie algebras <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{h}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <a href="#TO:simply-connected-space">simply connected</a>, then any morphism of Lie algebras <span class="math inline">\(f : \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}\)</span> lifts uniquely to a morphism of Lie groups <span class="math inline">\(F : G \to H\)</span>, that is, <span class="math inline">\(dF_e = f\)</span>.
</li><li> Every Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of a (simply connected) Lie group.
