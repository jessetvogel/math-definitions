Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a>, and take a point <span class="math inline">\(x_0 \in X\)</span>. The <b>fundamental group</b> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> w.r.t. the basepoint <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[ \pi_1(X, x_0) = \{ \text{continuous } f : [0, 1] \to X : f(0) = x_0 = f(1) \} / \sim{} , \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(f \sim{} g\)</span> if the paths are homotopic.<br/>
The group multiplication is given by concatenating paths, and inversion is given by inverting paths. In general, the fundamental group is not abelian.
