An <b>exact category</b> is an <a href="#HA:additive-category">additive category</a> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> with a class <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> of sequences
<span class="math display">\[ A \to B \to C \]</span>
(referred to as ‘<i>short exact sequences</i>’) such that
<ul><li> <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is closed under isomorphisms and contains all canonical sequences of the form
<span class="math display">\[ A \to A \oplus C \to C , \]</span>
</li><li> if <span class="math inline">\(B \to C\)</span> occurs as the second arrow of a sequence in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> (called an <i>admissible epimorphism</i>) and <span class="math inline">\(D \to C\)</span> is any morphism, then the pullback exists, and the projection to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is an admissible epimorphism as well. Dually, if <span class="math inline">\(A \to B\)</span> occurs as the first arrow of a sequence in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> (called an <i>admissible monomorphism</i>) and <span class="math inline">\(A \to D\)</span> is any morphism, then the pushout exists, and the inclusion from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is also an admissible monomorphism,
</li><li> admissible monomorphisms are kernels of their corresponding admissible epimorphisms, and dually admissible epimorphisms are cokernels of their corresponding admissible monomorphisms. The composition of two admissible monomorphisms is admissible, and similarly for admissible epimorphisms.
</li></ul>
