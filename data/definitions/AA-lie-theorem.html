Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{g}\)</span> be a <a href="#AA:solvable-lie-algebra">solvable</a> <a href="#AA:lie-algebra">Lie algebra</a> over an <a href="#CA:algebraically-closed-field">algebraically closed</a> field of characteristic zero, and <span class="math inline">\(\rho : \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{gl}(V)\)</span> a finite-dimensional representation. Then <b>Lieâ€™s theorem</b> states that there exists a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\mathfrak{g})\)</span>-invariant subspaces
<span class="math display">\[ V = V_0 \supset V_1 \supset \cdots \supset V_n = 0 \]</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(\dim (V/V_i) = i\)</span>.<br/>
That is, there exists a basis for <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\mathfrak{g})\)</span> is represented by upper triangular matrices.
