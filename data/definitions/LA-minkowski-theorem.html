Let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be a lattice in <span class="math inline">\(\RR^n\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(S \subset \RR^n\)</span> a convex subset, which is symmetric with respect to the origin. That is, for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in S\)</span> also <span class="math inline">\(-x \in S\)</span>. Then <b>Minkowskiâ€™s theorem</b> states that if the volume of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is strictly larger than <span class="math inline">\(2^n \det(L)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> must contain at least one non-zero lattice point of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.
