An <b>additive category</b> is a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> such that
<ul><li> every <span class="math inline">\(\Hom_\mathcal{A}(A, B)\)</span> is an abelian group, and composition is bilinear,
</li><li> there is a <a href="#CT:zero-object">zero object</a> <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> which is both <a href="#CT:terminal-object">terminal</a> and <a href="#CT:initial-object">initial</a>,
</li><li> finite direct sums and finite direct products exist, and coincide.
</li></ul>
