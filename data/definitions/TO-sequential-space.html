Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a>. A subset <span class="math inline">\(A \subset X\)</span> is <i>sequentially closed</i> if every point <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> which is the limit of a <a href="#TO:convergent-sequence">convergent sequence</a> <span class="math inline">\((a_n)_{n \in \NN}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, is contained in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. The space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>sequential</b> if every sequentially closed subset of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is closed.
