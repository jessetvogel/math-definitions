The <b>Picard group</b> <span class="math inline">\(\text{Pic}(X)\)</span> of a scheme <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the abelian group of isomorphism classes of <a href="#AG:invertible-sheaf">invertible sheaves</a> on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, where addition is given by the tensor product
<span class="math display">\[ [\mathcal{L}_1] + [\mathcal{L}_2] = [\mathcal{L}_1 \otimes \mathcal{L}_2] . \]</span>
