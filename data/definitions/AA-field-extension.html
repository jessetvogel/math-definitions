A <b>field extension</b> is an inclusion of <a href="#AA:field">fields</a> <span class="math inline">\(k \hookrightarrow \ell\)</span>. We also say that <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is a field <i>over</i> <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and write <span class="math inline">\(k \subset \ell\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\ell / k\)</span>.<br/>
Note that any morphism of fields <span class="math inline">\(k \to \ell\)</span> is injective, and hence a field extension, as the only ideals of a field are <span class="math inline">\((0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1)\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> does not lie in the kernel.
