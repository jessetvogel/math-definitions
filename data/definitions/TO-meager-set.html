Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a>. A subset <span class="math inline">\(A \subset X\)</span> is called <i>nowhere dense</i> if its <a href="#TO:closure">closure</a> has an empty <a href="#TO:interior">interior</a>. A subset <span class="math inline">\(B \subset X\)</span> is called <b>meager</b> if it is a countable union of nowhere dense subsets of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.<br/>
The topological space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is called <b>meager</b> if it is a meager subset of itself.
