A <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <b>metacompact</b> if for every open cover <span class="math inline">\(\{ U_i : i \in I \}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, there exists a <a href="#TO:cover-refinement">refinement</a> <span class="math inline">\(\{ V_j : j \in J \}\)</span> which is again an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, such that every point <span class="math inline">\(x \in X\)</span> is contained in only finitely many <span class="math inline">\(V_j\)</span>.
