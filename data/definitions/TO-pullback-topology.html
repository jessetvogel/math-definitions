Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a <a href="#TO:topological-space">topological space</a> and <span class="math inline">\(f : Y \to X\)</span> a map of sets. The <b>pullback topology</b> on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> induced by <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the topology on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> given by
<span class="math display">\[ \mathcal{T}_Y = \{ f^{-1}(U) \;:\; U \subset X \textup{ open} \} . \]</span>
It is the <a href="#TO:coarser">coarsest</a> topology on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous.
