Let <span class="math inline">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\)</span> be a <a href="#PT:random-sample">random sample</a> from a population <span class="math inline">\(F_\theta\)</span> depending on some parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in a parameter space <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>.
A <i>hypothesis testing problem</i> for <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is a partition of <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span> into a subset <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_0 \subseteq \Theta\)</span> and its complement <span class="math inline">\(\Theta \setminus \Theta_0\)</span>.
The <i>null hypothesis</i>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, states that <span class="math inline">\(\theta \in \Theta_0\)</span>, and the <i>alternative hypothesis</i>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, states that <span class="math inline">\(\theta \in \Theta \setminus \Theta_0\)</span>.<br/>
A <b>hypothesis test</b> is a rule that specifies:
<ol type="(i)"><li> for which sample values of <span class="math inline">\(X = (X_1, \ldots, X_n)\)</span> the decision is made to accept <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> as true,
</li><li> for which sample values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> the decision is made to reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and accept <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span> as true.
</li></ol>
The first subset of sample values is called the <i>acceptance region</i> and the second subset of sample values is called the <i>rejection region</i>.
