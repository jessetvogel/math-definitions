A ring morphism <span class="math inline">\(R \to S\)</span> is said to be of <b>finite presentation</b> if <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is isomorphic to a quotient of <span class="math inline">\(R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\)</span> for some integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.<br/>
In this case, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is also said to be a <b>finitely generated <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>-algebra</b>.
