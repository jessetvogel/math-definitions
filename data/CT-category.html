    A <b>category</b> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is given by a collection of <i>objects</i> and <i>morphisms</i>.
    <ul><li> Each morphism has a <i>domain</i> and <i>codomain</i>, which are objects. We write <span class="math inline">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(X \overset{f}{\to} Y\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the domain of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> the codomain. We also write <span class="math inline">\(X = \text{dom}(X)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y = \text{cod}(Y)\)</span>.
        
        </li><li> Given two morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\text{cod}(f) = \text{dom}(g)\)</span>, the <b>composition</b> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, written <span class="math inline">\(gf\)</span>, is defined and has domain <span class="math inline">\(\text{dom}(f)\)</span> and codomain <span class="math inline">\(\text{cod}(g)\)</span>.
        
        </li><li> Composition is associative, i.e. <span class="math inline">\((fg)h = f(gh)\)</span>.
        
        </li><li> For every object <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> there is an <i>identity</i> morphism <span class="math inline">\(\id_X : X \to X\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(f \id_X = f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\id_X g = g\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(f, g\)</span>.
    </li></ul>
