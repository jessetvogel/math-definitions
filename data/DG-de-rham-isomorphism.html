The <b>de Rham isomorphism</b> is the isomorphism given by
<span class="math display">\[ H_{\textup{dR}}^k(X) \xrightarrow{\sim} H^k(X; \RR) : [ \omega ] \mapsto \int_{(-)} \omega . \]</span><br/>
The exterior product endows the direct sum of these groups with a ring structure. A further result of the theorem is that the two cohomology rings are isomorphic (as graded rings), where the analogous product on singular cohomology is the cup product.
