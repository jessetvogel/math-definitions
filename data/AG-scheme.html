A <b>scheme</b> is a <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('AG:ringed-space');">locally ringed space</a> <span class="math inline">\((X, \mathcal{O}_X)\)</span> in which every point has an open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((U, \mathcal{O}_X|_U)\)</span> is an <a href="javascript:gotoTopic('AG:affine-scheme');">affine scheme</a>. A morphism of schemes is a morphism of locally ringed spaces.<br/>
One calls <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> the <i>underlying topological space</i>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span> its <i>structure sheaf</i>.
