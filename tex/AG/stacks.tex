\begin{topic}{stack}{stack}
    A \textbf{stack} (over a \tref{CT:site}{site} $\mathfrak{S}$) is a \tref{CT:category-fibered-in-groupoids}{category fibered in groupoids} over $\mathfrak{S}$ such that every \tref{CT:descent-datum}{descent datum} is effective and isomorphisms are a sheaf. Morphisms of stacks are defined as morphisms of categories over $\mathfrak{S}$, and similarly for 2-morphisms and isomorphisms.

\begin{topic}{artin-stack}{Artin stack}
    A \tref{stack}{stack} $\mathfrak{X}$ is an \textbf{Artin stack} if there exists a smooth and surjective representable morphism $S \to \mathfrak{X}$ for some scheme $S$. The morphism $S \to \mathfrak{X}$ is also called a \textit{presentation} for $\mathfrak{X}$.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{deligne-mumford-stack}{Deligne-Mumford stack}
    A \tref{stack}{stack} $\mathfrak{X}$ is an \textbf{Deligne--Mumford stack} if there exists an Ã©tale and surjective representable morphism $S \to \mathfrak{X}$ for some scheme $S$. The morphism $S \to \mathfrak{X}$ is also called a \textit{presentation} for $\mathfrak{X}$.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{quotient-stack}{quotient stack}
    If $G$ is an algebraic group acting on a scheme $S$, the \textbf{quotient stack} $[S/G]$ is defined as the category over $\textbf{Sch}$ whose objects over $T$ are principal $G$-bundles $P \to T$, with a $G$-equivariant morphism $P \to S$. Its morphisms are $G$-equivariant isomorphisms which are compatible with the morphisms to $S$.
