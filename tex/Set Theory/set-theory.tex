\begin{topic}{power-set}{power set}
    The \textbf{power set} of a set $A$ is the set of all subsets of $A$,
    \[ P(A) = \{ B \mid B \subset A \} . \]
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{cantor-theorem}{Cantor's theorem}
    \textbf{Cantor's theorem} states that for any set $A$, there does not exist a surjective function from $A$ to the \tref{power-set}{power set} $P(A)$ of $A$.
\end{topic}

\begin{example}{cantor-theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose for a contradiction that $f : A \to P(A)$ is a surjective function, and let $S = \{ x \in A \mid x \not\in f(x) \}$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exists some $x \in A$ with $f(x) = S$. But now, by definition of $S$,
        \[ x \in S \iff x \not\in f(x) = S , \]
        which is a contradiction.
    \end{proof}
\end{example}

\begin{topic}{axiom-of-choice}{axiom of choice}
    The \textbf{axiom of choice} states that for every set $X$ of non-empty sets, there exists a function
    \[ f : X \to \bigcup_{A \in X} A \]
    such that $f(A) \in A$ for all $A \in X$.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{cantor-set}{Cantor set}
    The \textbf{Cantor set} is the set
    \[ C = \bigcap_{n = 0}^{\infty} C_n , \]
    where $C_0 = [0, 1]$ and $C_n = \frac{1}{3} \left( C_{n - 1} \cup (2 + C_{n - 1}) \right)$ for any $n \ge 1$.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{partition}{partition}
    A \textbf{partition} of a set $X$ is a set $P$ of subsets of $X$ such that $\bigcup_{A \in P} A = X$ and $A \cap B = \varnothing$ for distinct $A, B \in P$.
\end{topic}
