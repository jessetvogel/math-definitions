    Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category, and consider the following commutative diagram.
    \[ \begin{tikzcd} A \arrow{r}{f} \arrow{d}{\ell} & B \arrow{r}{g} \arrow{d}{m} & C \arrow{r}{h} \arrow{d}{n} & D \arrow{r}{i} \arrow{d}{p} & E \arrow{d}{q} \\ A' \arrow{r}{f'} & B' \arrow{r}{g'} & C' \arrow{r}{h'} & D \arrow{r}{i'} & E' \end{tikzcd} \]
    Suppose that both rows are exact. The \textbf{five lemma} states that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if $m$ and $p$ are injective and $\ell$ is surjective, then $n$ is injective.
        
        \item if $m$ and $p$ are surjective and $q$ is injective, then $n$ is surjective.
        
        \item if $m$ and $p$ are isomorphisms, $\ell$ is surjective and $q$ is injective, then $n$ is an isomorphism.
    \end{itemize}
\end{topic}
