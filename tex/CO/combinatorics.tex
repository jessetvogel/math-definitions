\begin{topic}{graph}{graph}
    A \textbf{graph} consists of a set $V$ together with a set $E \subset \{ \{ x, y \} : x, y \in V \textup{ and } x \ne y \}$.
    
    A \textbf{directed graph} consists of a set $V$ together with a set $E \subset \{ (x, y) : x, y \in V \textup{ and } x \ne y \}$.
    
    The elements of $V$ are called \textit{vertices} and the elements of $E$ are called \textit{edges}.
