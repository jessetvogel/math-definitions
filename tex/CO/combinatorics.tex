\begin{topic}{graph}{graph}
    A \textbf{graph} consists of a set $V$ together with a set $E \subset \{ \{ x, y \} : x, y \in V \textup{ and } x \ne y \}$.
    
    A \textbf{directed graph} consists of a set $V$ together with a set $E \subset \{ (x, y) : x, y \in V \textup{ and } x \ne y \}$.
    
    The elements of $V$ are called \textit{vertices} and the elements of $E$ are called \textit{edges}.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{matroid}{matroid}
    A \textbf{(finite) matroid} is a finite set $E$, called the \textit{ground set}, together with a set $I$ of subsets of $E$, known as the \textit{independent subsets}, such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\varnothing \in I$,
        \item if $B \in I$ and $A \subset B$, then $A \in I$,
        \item if $A, B \in I$ and $|B| > |A|$, then there exists an $b \in B$ such that $A \cup \{ b \} \in I$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{topic}

\begin{example}{matroid}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $E$ be a \tref{LA:vector-space}{vector space}, and $I$ the set of \tref{LA:linearly-independent}{linearly independent} subsets of $E$. Then $(E, I)$ is a matroid.
        \item Let $G$ be a finite \tref{graph}{graph}, and $E$ its set of edges. Let $I$ be the set of subsets of edges that are a \textit{forest}, that is, subsets of edges that do not contain a cycle. Then $(E, I)$ is a matroid.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{topic}{tutte-polynomial}{Tutte polynomial}
    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a \tref{graph}{graph}. The \textbf{Tutte polynomial} of $G$ is the polynomial, in two variables $x$ and $y$, given by
    \[ T_G(x, y) = \sum_{E' \subset E} (x - 1)^{k(E') - k(E)} (y - 1)^{k(E') + |E'| - |V|} \]
    where $k(E')$ denotes the number of connected components of the graph $(V, E')$.
