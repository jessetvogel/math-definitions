    \textbf{Diaconescu's theorem} states that the \tref{ST:axiom-of-choice}{axiom of choice} implies the law of the excluded middle.
\end{topic}

\begin{example}{diaconescu-theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $P$ be any proposition. Define the sets
        \[ A = \{ x \in \{ 0, 1 \} \mid (x = 0) \lor P \} \quad \textup{ and } \quad B = \{ x \in \{ 0, 1 \} \mid (x = 1) \lor P \} . \]
        By the axiom of choice, there exists a function $f : \{ A, B \} \to A \cup B$ such that $f(A) \in A$ and $f(B) \in B$. By definition of $A$ and $B$, this means that
        \[ (f(A) = 0) \lor P \quad \textup{ and } \quad (f(B) = 1) \lor P , \]
        which is equivalent to
        \[ (f(A) \ne f(B)) \lor P . \]
        Now, since $P \Rightarrow (A = B) \Rightarrow (f(A) = f(B))$, it follows that $(f(A) \ne f(B)) \Rightarrow \neg P$, which shows that $\neg P \lor P$.
    \end{proof}
