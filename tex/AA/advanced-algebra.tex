% \begin{topic}{dg-algebra}{differential graded algebra}
%     A \textbf{differential graded algebra} $A$ is a graded algebra with a map $d : A \to A$ having degree $1$ (cochain complex convention) or $-1$ (chain complex convention) satisfying
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item (\textit{chain condition}) $d^2 = 0$, this gives $A$ the structure of a (co)chain complex,
%         \item (\textit{graded Leibniz rule}) $d(a \cdot b) = (da) \cdot b + (-1)^{\deg(a)} a \cdot (db)$.
%     \end{itemize}

% \begin{topic}{dg-category}{differential graded category}
%     A \textbf{differential graded category (dg-category)} is a category \tref{CT:enriched-category}{enriched} over the category of \tref{HA:chain-complex}{cochain complexes}. Concretely, its morphism sets are \tref{chain-complex}{cochain complexes}, that is, for any objects $A$ and $B$,
%     \[ \Hom(A, B) = \bigoplus_{n \in \ZZ} \Hom_n(A, B) \]
%     with differential $d : \Hom_n(A, B) \to \Hom_{n + 1}(A, B)$ such that $d^2 = 0$. Furthermore, composition of morphisms
%     \[ \Hom(A, B) \otimes \Hom(B, C) \to \Hom(A, C) \]
%     must be a chain map and $d(\id_A) = 0$.

% \begin{example}{dg-category}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Any \tref{dg-algebra}{differential graded algebra} $A$ can be considered as a dg-category with a single object whose endomorphisms are given by $A$.

\begin{topic}{dg-algebra}{(commutative) differential graded algebra}
    A \textbf{differential graded algebra (dga)} over a \tref{field}{field} $k$ is a \tref{HA:chain-complex}{chain complex} $(A_\bdot, d)$ of $k$-modules with a multiplication map $A_i \times A_j \to A_{i + j}$, satisfying the Leibniz rule
    \[ d(ab) = b d(a) + (-1)^{\deg(a)} a d(b) \]
    for all $a, b \in A_\bdot$.
    
    A dga is \textbf{commutative} if $ab = (-1)^{\deg(a) \deg(b)} ba$ for all $a, b \in A_\bdot$.
