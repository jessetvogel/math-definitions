\begin{topic}{hodge-structure}{Hodge structure}
    A \textbf{Hodge structure of weight $k \in \ZZ$} is a pair $H = (H_\ZZ, \{ H^{p, q} \})$ consisting of a $\ZZ$-module $H_\ZZ$ and a direct sum decomposition of the complexification $H_\CC = H_\ZZ \otimes \CC$,
    \[ H_\CC = \bigoplus_{p + q = k} H^{p, q} \]
    such that $H^{q, p} = \overline{H^{p, q}}$.

    Equivalently, a \textbf{Hodge structure of weight $k \in \ZZ$} is a pair $H = (H_\ZZ, F^\bdot)$ consisting of a $\ZZ$-module $H_\ZZ$ and a decreasing filtration $F_\bdot$ on $H_\CC$, called the \textit{Hodge filtration},
    \[ H_\CC \supset \cdots \supset F^p \supset F^{p + 1} \supset \cdots \supset 0 \]
    such that $H_\CC = F^p \oplus \overline{F^q}$ for all $p + q = k + 1$.

    The two descriptions are related via
    \[ F^p = \bigoplus_{r \ge p} H^{r, k - r} \quad \textup{ and } \quad H^{p, q} = F^p \cap \overline{F^q} . \]

    A \textbf{morphism of Hodge structures} $f : H \to H'$ is a morphism $f : H_\ZZ \to H'_\ZZ$ of $\ZZ$-modules whose complexification $f_\CC$ preserves type, that is, $f_\CC\left(H^{p, q}\right) \subset (H')^{p, q}$.
    
    One speaks of \textit{rational} or \textit{real} Hodge structures when replacing $H_\ZZ$ by a rational or real vector space.
        
    The numbers $h^{p, q}(H) := \dim_\CC H^{p, q}$ are called the \textbf{Hodge numbers} of the Hodge structure.

\begin{example}{hodge-structure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For any $H_\ZZ$, taking $H^{k, k} = H_\CC$ and $H^{p, q} = 0$ when $(p, q) \ne (k, k)$ gives the \textit{trivial Hodge structure} of weight $2k$.
        \item Take $H_\ZZ = 2 \pi i \ZZ \subset \CC$ and $H_\CC = H^{-1, -1}$. This is a Hodge structure of weight $-2$. In fact, is the unique $1$-dimensional Hodge structure of weight $-2$ up to isomorphism, and it is called the \textit{Tate Hodge structure}, often denoted by $\ZZ(1)$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}{hodge-structure}
    Let $M$ be a \tref{TO:compact-space}{compact} \tref{DG:kahler-manifold}{KÃ¤hler manifold} of dimension $2n$. The \textit{Hodge decomposition theorem} states that the \tref{DG:de-rham-cohomology}{de Rham cohomology} of $M$ carries a Hodge structure
    \[ H_\textup{dR}^k(M) \otimes_\RR \CC \cong \bigoplus_{p + q = k} H^{p, q}(M) , \]
    where $H^{p, q}(M)$ are the cohomology classes whose \textit{harmonic representative} is of type $(p, q)$.
\end{example}

\begin{topic}{hodge-polynomial}{Hodge polynomial}
    The \textbf{Hodge polynomial} of a \tref{hodge-structure}{Hodge structure} $H$ is the polynomial,
    \[ P_\textup{hodge}(H) = \sum_{p, q \in \ZZ} h^{p, q}(H) u^p v^q , \]
    where $h^{p, q}(H) = \dim_\CC H^{p, q}$ denote the Hodge numbers.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{mixed-hodge-structure}{mixed Hodge structure}
    A \textbf{mixed Hodge structure} is a triple $H = (H_\ZZ, W_\bdot, F^\bdot)$ consisting of a $\ZZ$-module $H_\ZZ$, an increasing filtration $W_\bdot$ on $H_\QQ = H_\ZZ \otimes \QQ$,
    \[ 0 \subset \cdots \subset W_k \subset W_{k + 1} \cdots \subset H_\QQ \]
    and a decreasing filtration $F^\bdot$ on $H_\CC = H_\ZZ \otimes \CC$,
    \[ H_\CC \supset \cdots \supset F^p \supset F^{p + 1} \supset \cdots \supset 0 \]
    such that the induced filtrations (obtained by intersections) of $F^\bdot$ on the graded pieces $\left(\textup{Gr}^W_k H_\QQ\right) \otimes_\QQ \CC := \left(W_k H_\QQ / W_{k - 1} H_\QQ\right) \otimes_\QQ \CC$ are \tref{hodge-structure}{rational Hodge structures} of weight $k$.
    
    A \textbf{morphism of mixed Hodge structures} is a morphism $f : H_\ZZ \to H'_\ZZ$ of $\ZZ$-modules compatible with the two filtrations $W_\bdot$ and $F^\bdot$.
    
    The numbers $h^{p, q}(H) := \dim_\CC \textup{Gr}_F^p \textup{Gr}^W_{p + q}(H_\CC)$ are called the \textbf{mixed Hodge numbers} of the mixed Hodge structure $H$.
